Create a new workflow Adding Triggers Adding Logic Nodes Configuring the Nodes Returning data from the Workflow Question? Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 What is a Workflow? A workflow is a visual representation of a logical sequence of tasks designed to achieve a specific goal. Each task\nis represented by a node, and workflows are constructed to automate processes, streamline tasks, and efficiently respond\nto various events. Key characteristics of workflows include: Trigger Nodes: The first node is a trigger that initiates the workflow Nodes: Each node represents a specific task or action within the workflow Return Nodes: The last node can be a return statement, providing optional final outputs How to build a Workflow? Here's a comprehensive guide to building a workflow using BuildShip: Create a new workflow Begin by initiating a new workflow on the BuildShip dashboard. Navigate to the BuildShip dashboard and click on the \" New Workflow \" button. \ud83d\udca1 Alternatively, you can select a suitable template from the available options. Adding Triggers Triggers initiate workflows based on specific events. Click on the \" Add a Trigger \" button within your newly created workflow. Select from the list of existing triggers,\nsuch as HTTP Requests , Scheduled Intervals , or Cron Jobs . Adding Logic Nodes Logic nodes perform tasks and actions within your workflow. Explore the Nodeverse, which offers a variety of pre-built nodes for data processing, communication, and more. Select\nnodes that align with the tasks you want to accomplish. You could also create your own custom nodes using the \" Generate with AI \" feature from the Nodeverse . Configuring the Nodes With BuildShip's low-code capabilities, configuring each node is a user-friendly process that empowers you to tailor\nyour workflow to your exact requirements. Here's how you can do it: Click on the Script Icon on the node to open the Node Editor . Personalize the node's behavior according to your specific needs by manipulating the Node Logic, Input Params, Output,\nas well as the Node Description. Returning data from the Workflow Optionally, include a return statement at the end of your workflow. The return statement provides output values that can be used for further processing or as a response. Congratulations! You've successfully created a dynamic workflow tailored to your needs. \ud83d\ude80 Need Help? \ud83d\udcac Join BuildShip Community An active and large community of no-code / low-code builders.

The input configuration is a JSON object that defines the input parameters for a node. Let's understand the structure using an example, here's a sample input configuration for a node: { \"type\" : \"object\" , \"properties\" : { \"apiKey\" : { \"title\" : \"API Key\" , \"description\" : \"The Bearer token for the Cohere API. (Get your Cohere API key [here](https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys).)\" , \"type\" : \"string\" , \"pattern\" : \"\" , \"buildship\" : { \"index\" : 1 , \"sensitive\" : true } } , \"texts\" : { \"title\" : \"Texts\" , \"description\" : \"The array of texts to detect language for.

In your example, it\ndefines two input parameters: apiKey and texts . type: This specifies the overall data type of the input. In this case, it is set as \"object,\" indicating that the\ninput parameters are organized within an object structure. required: This is an array that can list any required parameters, but it's currently empty, indicating that none\nof the parameters are mandatory. Input Parameter Definition The input parameters are defined as follows: title : The user-friendly title or label for the input parameter, which is \"API Key\" in this case. description : Additional information or description of the parameter, which is \"Cohere API Key.\" type : Specifies the data type of the parameter, which is \"string.\" pattern : An optional field, typically used for validating the input value. In this example, it's an empty string. buildship : An object that includes additional metadata for the parameter, such as its index within the list of\nparameters and whether it is marked as sensitive (containing sensitive or private data).

Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 Node Input Validation In BuildShip, you have the ability to specify a regular expression pattern for input fields. This allows you to define a\npattern that a value must match to be considered valid. If the value provided in the input does not match the specified pattern, the workflow will generate a node validation\nerror, preventing the execution of the workflow. How to Specify Validation Regex To configure Validation Regex for an input field, follow these steps: Open the Node Editor Once you have a node for which you wish to validate the inputs, open the node editor by clicking on the </> icon in the top right corner of the node. Open the Input Editor Navigate to the \"Inputs\" tab within the Node Editor and select the input field/s you wish to validate. Specify the Validation Regex You'll spot the \" Validation Regex \" at the bottom of the input editor. Enter the regular expression pattern you wish\nto use to validate the input field. Test the Validation Regex Once this is done, click the \"Save\" button to save your changes. You can test your validation regex by entering a value\nthat does not match the pattern you specified. If the value does not match the pattern, you'll see a validation error\nappear below the input field when you click on the \" Ship \" button. Example Validation Regex Let's consider an example using the regular expression pattern ^[A-Za-z0-9]+$ . This specific pattern is designed to\nmatch a string that consists of one or more alphanumeric characters, which includes letters (both uppercase and\nlowercase) and digits. Here's how the process works: Input Field Configuration In the Node Editor, you pick the input field you want to validate, and you add the regular expression pattern in the Validation Regex field for that input. Pattern Matching When the workflow is executed, the Validation Regex function checks if the value provided in the input field matches the\nregular expression pattern defined in the Validation Regex field. Validation Results CASE 1: If the input is abc123 , it matches the pattern (consisting of alphanumeric characters only), and\ntherefore, no validation error is generated. The workflow proceeds as expected. CASE 2: If the input is abc-123 ,it contains a hyphen, which does not match the specified pattern. In this case,\nthe workflow will generate a validation error before proceeding, preventing the building of the workflow.

Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 Update Node Output Each Script Node in BuildShip has the following configurations: Node Logic : The core functionality of the node. Inputs : The input parameters required by the node. Output : The output schema defining the structure of the data returned by the node. Info : Additional information or metadata about the node. The Output configuration tab allows you to define the structure of the output generated by the node. This output\nconfiguration makes it easier for users to access the specific values being returned from the node without using complex\ndot notations. For example, if a node returns a JSON object with the following structure: { \"content\" : \"This is some content.\" , \"metadata\" : { \"author\" : \"John Doe\" , \"timestamp\" : \"2023-04-01T12:00:00Z\" } } The output configuration can be set to expose the content , metadata.author , and metadata.timestamp properties\ndirectly, allowing users to access them in subsequent nodes without using dot notation like nodeOutput.metadata.author . Auto-Updating Node Output When building or customizing a node, you can automatically update the output schema based on the actual output generated\nby the node logic. Here are the steps to auto-update the node output: Open the node editor and make any necessary changes to the node logic. Click the \" Test Node \" button to execute the node and view its output. In the output section, you should see an option to \" Update Output Schema \". Click this button. The output configuration tab will be updated with the schema of the output generated by the node logic. By auto-updating the output schema, you ensure that the output configuration accurately reflects the structure of the\ndata returned by the node. This allows you to use the different or nested outputs returned by the node in subsequent\nnodes directly from the context menu, as shown in the image below.

Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 API Specification The API Specification feature allows users to define and structure incoming requests and expected responses for their\nworkflow APIs. This functionality simplifies accessing request values as defined variables throughout the workflow. Request Specification \u26a0\ufe0f This is only applicable while using REST API Trigger node. Users can define the expected request structure for the API Call. Click on the Trigger Menu (\u2022\u2022\u2022) on the REST API Call Trigger and click on Edit . Under the \u201cRequest\u201d section you\u2019ll see the default request structure. Click on the + icon to add fields to the request schema. You can also click on a field, let\u2019s say query , to add\nnested fields and parameters. Response Specification Users can also define the expected response from the API. Click on the </> icon on the Return Node to open the Response Specification . Under the \u201cResponse\u201d section you\u2019ll see the default response structure. { \"200\" : { \"title\" : \"Success Response\" , \"type\" : \"object\" , \"properties\" : { \"text\" : { // added this property \"type\" : \"string\" , \"description\" : \"The generated text\" } } } } Accessing Request Values Users can access the request values defined in the Request Specification throughout the workflow using the Context\nMenu . Example Scenario - Implementing BYOK Let's consider implementing a Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) system within BuildShip. We require incoming API requests to include an Authorization header containing the user's API Key. Additionally, the\nAPI needs a prompt query parameter, which will act as the User Prompt for the OpenAI Text Generator node generating a\nstory. To modify the Request Definition for this scenario: Go to the Request section in your REST API Call trigger. Define the Authorization header: Click on the Request Headers and use the + icon to add a nested field. Provide\nappropriate Label, Key, Description, and set its type to string. Define the prompt query parameter: Click on the Query section and add a nested field using the + icon. Provide\nappropriate Label, Key, Description, and set its type to string. These defined request variables can now be easily accessed via the context menu throughout the workflow.

Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 BuildShip Tables BuildShip Tables give you an easy visual way to manage your BuildShip Database. Every BuildShip project comes with a\nready-to-use Firestore database. With BuildShip, you get the ultimate flexibility to choose the database that best works for your project. Use BuildShip Database: If you are looking for quick and ready-to-use database with an instant database management\nUI. Pick Your Own Database: Firestore, Postgres, Supabase, MySQL\u2026.or any database. Choose a database that works for\nyou if you do not want to use the BuildShip database. In this case, you can simply use them in the workflows and APIs\nusing CRUD nodes. How to use BuildShip Table If you're using the BuildShip database , by using the BuildShip Database nodes in your workflows, you can access\nBuildShip Tables to visualize and manage the data populated by these nodes. \u26a0\ufe0f You can use BuildShip database in your workflows using the BuildShip Database CRUD nodes, and access the data in a\ntabular format visually using the BuildShip Tables. (This feature is now available for users on all plans! \u2b50\ufe0f) Access BuildShip Table You can access BuildShip Tables directly from the CRUD node you are using. Once you click on the table icon\navailable on the BuildShip Database node, you'll be prompted to create a new table or select an existing table. \u26a0\ufe0f Ensure pop-ups are unblocked for buildship.app. Alternatively, you can access BuildShip Tables from the side navigation bar . Click on the Database icon to\naccess the BuildShip Tables. Creating Tables There are two ways of creating a BuildShip Table: Set up an existing collection After navigating to the Databases tab, users will be able to check out the existing collections as tables, if any. If\nyou do not have any existing tables, proceed to the Creating a new table section. To initialize an existing collection as a BuildShip table, simply click on the Setup \u27a4 button. Select the table type, or leave it as default. Under the Display section, users can edit the Table Name and ID . Optionally create and select display sections, add description for easy access. Under the Columns section, select the columns to initialize with the table. Click on Create . Now a table will be initialized for the collection name provided. Click on \u201cImport Existing Data\u201d to import the data\ninto your table. Follow the step-by-step guided process to import your data and hit \u201cFinish\u201d. Creating a new table Once you\u2019ve navigated to the \u201cDatabases\u201d tab, click on the \u201cCreate Table\u201d button. (or look for the \u271a icon on the\nbottom right corner to add a new table) Select a Collection Name. You can also copy and paste the name of the collection used in your BuildShip Database Nodes\nto import the existing data in your table. Optionally, you can add the display information for your table and select initial \u201cRow ID\u201d as the column. Users also\nhave the option to quickly copy existing column data from any existing tables. Click on \u201cCreate\u201d to create the table. Manipulating Table Data There are two ways to manipulate the Firebase Collection data associated with your table. Via BuildShip Table UI In your empty table, click on \u201c Add Column \u201d button. Add in the Field Name, Field Key, and the Field Type. \ud83d\udca1 If you already have existing fields in your collection, make sure to match the Field Key value with your existing\nkeys to sync data. Click on \u201c Add Row \u201d button to add values to your table. Via BuildShip Database Nodes BuildShip has pre-built CRUD nodes available under the BuildShip Database Integrations section in the Node\nLibrary. These nodes are similar to the Firestore database nodes and are meant to help you insert, query, and manipulate\nyour BuildShip Data. In the next section, we\u2019ll see how we can perform some basic operations on our data. BuildShip Database Nodes Let\u2019s see how we can perform some basic operations and visualize them in our BuildShip Tables interface: Creating Documents To create a document in a collection, we need to add the Create Document node from the BuildShip Database integration. To test it out, let\u2019s try to add the data in the collection connected to a BuildShip table. Add in the data as shown in\nthe image below. Querying Collection To query a collection, we can use the Collection Query node from the BuildShip Database integration. Add the collection name, same as the one linked to the BuildShip Table. Basic Filter For the Filters field, let\u2019s copy the sample input available in the Node Info (\u2139\ufe0f) and modify it according to our data. { \"field\" : \"name\" , \"operator\" : \"==\" , \"value\" : \"Marta\" } This will return all the documents where the field name is equal to Marta. Tip: Click here (opens in a new tab) for a list of all\nthe operators available for filtering. Multiple Filters Example 1: Filtering with OR. To add multiple filters, we can use the logic field to specify the logic to be applied\nto the filters. For example: { \"logic\" : \"OR\" , \"filters\" : [ { \"field\" : \"active\" , \"operator\" : \"==\" , \"value\" : false } , { \"field\" : \"name\" , \"operator\" : \"==\" , \"value\" : \"doe\" } ] } This will return all the documents where the field \u201cactive\u201d is false OR the field \u201cname\u201d is doe. Example 2: Filtering with AND. To filter with AND, we can use the same logic field to specify the logic to be\napplied to. For example: { \"logic\" : \"AND\" , \"filters\" : [ { \"field\" : \"active\" , \"operator\" : \"==\" , \"value\" : false } , { \"field\" : \"name\" , \"operator\" : \"==\" , \"value\" : \"doe\" } ] } This will return all the documents where the field \u201cactive\u201d is false AND the field \u201cname\u201d is doe. Nested Filters We can also nest filters to create complex queries. For example: { \"logic\" : \"AND\" , \"filters\" : [ { \"field\" : \"technology\" , \"operator\" : \"==\" , \"value\" : \"Firebase\" } , { \"logic\" : \"OR\" , \"filters\" : [ { \"field\" : \"admin\" , \"operator\" : \"==\" , \"value\" : true } , { \"field\" : \"age\" , \"operator\" : \">=\" , \"value\" : 18 } ] } ] } This will return all the documents where the field \u201ctechnology\u201d is equal to \u201cFirebase\u201d AND the field \u201cadmin\u201d is true OR\nthe field \u201cage\u201d is greater than or equal to 18. Bonus: Filter by Reference To filter by reference we can use the convention collectionName/documentID for the filter value. For example: { \"field\" : \"user_ref\" , \"operator\" : \"==\" , \"value\" : \"users/user123\" } This will return all the documents where the field \u201cuser_ref\u201d is equal to \u201cusers/user123\u201d. Values passed in this format\nwill be treated as references. Next, let\u2019s limit the number of responses being returned by specifying a limit and add a condition to order the results.\nFor example: [{ name : 'asc' }]; // order in ascending order by the username Get Document To get a document from a collection, lets use the Get Document node from the BuildShip Database integration. Add in the Collection Name and the Document ID to retrieve. Updating Fields To update a field in the document from a collection, lets use the Update Field Value node from the BuildShip\nDatabase integration. For this, we\u2019d require the Document Path instead of the Collection Name and Document ID. To get the Document Path,\nlet\u2019s go to our BuildShip Table for the document we wish to update. Right click any value for that particular row and\nclick on \u201c Copy Path \u201d. Paste the copied document path in the input field. The Document Path is in the following format: collectionName/DocumentID Add in the fieldName to update and the value to update. Delete Document To update a field in the document from a collection, lets use the Delete Document node from the BuildShip\nDatabase integration. Add in the Collection Name and the Document ID of the document to delete. Need Help? \ud83d\udcac Join BuildShip Community An active and large community of no-code / low-code builders.

Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 OAuth Nodes OAuth Nodes are a new addition to the BuildShip Node Library, designed to seamlessly integrate with various services\nthrough OAuth authentication. These nodes simplify the integration process by enabling connections with our favorite integrations without the need for\nadditional setup involving API Keys or IDs. Key Features One-Click Integration : Easily connect with selected integrations with a single click. No Additional Configuration : Avoid the hassle of managing API Keys or IDs. User-Friendly Interface : Recognizable by the Fingerprint Icon situated on the top right corner of the node,\nenabling authentication. Authenticating with OAuth Nodes OAuth Nodes feature a Fingerprint Icon initially highlighted in red, indicating a lack of authentication to any specific\naccount. Initiating Authentication Click on the Fingerprint Icon associated with the node. This action triggers an authentication window, prompting users to log in to the integration. Successful Authentication Upon successful login, the Fingerprint Icon turns green, signifying a completed authentication process. In the event the icon doesn't change automatically, users can manually select the authenticated user account by\nclicking the Fingerprint Icon again. Managing Accounts Switching/Addition of Accounts After a successful login, users can switch to or add a different account for the same integration using the following\nsteps: Click the Fingerprint Icon to access the menu. Select the \" Add an Account \" option to initiate authentication for a new account. Easily switch between accounts by selecting the desired account from the menu. Removing Accounts / Logging Out Click the Fingerprint Icon to open the authentication menu. Select the specific account to log out from. Click the \" Log Out \" button. \ud83d\udca1 Note: Ensure the account is selected before confirming the logout action. The logout action requires prior account\nselection to be successful. OAuth Nodes Mechanism Unlike the regular integration nodes which require you to provide an API Key, the OAuth Nodes redirect you to the OAuth\nprovider\u2019s authorization endpoint. After account is successfully logged in and the request for the permissions is approved, the authorization code is\nexchanged for an Access Token. This Access Token substitutes for the API Keys.

How to ship an API? How to use an API? Making API requests Question? Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 How to SHIP an API Building APIs is a complex process especially when you need to integrate multiple 3rd party integrations. BuildShip\nempowers you to effortlessly design, deploy, and manage APIs, providing a user-friendly platform that accelerates your\ndevelopment cycle. Learn how to build APIs step-by-step, leverage AI to build logic, focus on your business logic rather than intricate\ntechnical details. How to create an API? To begin creating an API, the initial step is to break down the API into smaller chunks. For example, let\u2019s say we wish to build an app which generates custom audio story books based on a prompt provided by the end user of your app and\nalso provide a cover image. What we understand till now is we will call an API from our app\u2019s front end which is gonna fetch the audio and cover\nimage for the prompt provided by the user and display it on the front end. But how do we break this down into small achievable steps? Let\u2019s build this app together and see... Step 1: When will the API be called? According to our example, we are supposed to have an input on the front end for the user to enter the prompt for the\naudio story book. The user would then hit a \u201cGenerate\u201d button which should send the prompt to the API, generate the\naudio story book and return it to the front end. The \u201c Generate \u201d button sends an HTTP request to an API Endpoint which we\u2019ll create using BuildShip. This is the\nstarting point of our API, the HTTP Trigger. Step 2: Specify the Request Structure Now let us define the HTTP Request structure that is going to trigger the API Endpoint. An API Request has the following\nstructure. The Request Endpoint will be the Rest API Call Endpoint that we set, which is https://008vd0.buildship.run/story-gen . For the Request Method , we can pick from GET , POST , PUT , and DELETE . Each method has it\u2019s own actions and\ncharacteristics. To learn more about each of these methods, check out the MDN Docs website (opens in a new tab) . For this example, we\u2019ll use the POST request method. The Query Params are the additional parameters to be appended to the end of the endpoint URL. We do have an option\nto pass in the prompt via the Query Params as shown in the image above, but for this example we\u2019ll pass in the prompt with the style value in the request body. We can also optionally add the HTTP Headers to pass additional information about the HTTP Request. To learn more\nabout the Headers to include, refer to the MDN Docs website (opens in a new tab) . \ud83d\udca1 TIP\ud83d\udca1: We also have a documentation on a very interesting use-case utilizing the Authorization Request Header to\nimplement \u201cBring Your Own Key\u201d (BYOK) using BuildShip. Learn more (opens in a new tab) . For the request body, let\u2019s pass in the values we require for our API from the user which are: Prompt - The main story line for the generation Style - The author style for the story being generated. Let\u2019s say you wish to generate a kids fairytale so we can\ninput \u201cBrothers Grimm\u201d to generate similar stories. The request body should look something like this: { \"prompt\": \"Two siblings discover the hidden mysteries of an enchanted garden\", \"style\": \"Brothers Grimm\" } \ud83d\udca1 For making it easy to access the values (opens in a new tab) for our request structure in the workflow input fields, we can specify the Request Structure in the REST API Call Trigger. Learn more (opens in a new tab) . Step 3: Generate the Story We can now get the prompt and style values from the request body, which we can now directly access from the context\nmenu. Now we need to generate our story via the prompt given by the user. Let\u2019s use the OpenAI GPT Text Generator node to\ngenerate the story, along with the cover image description, for us. Add the OpenAI API Key (which we can get from the OpenAI Developer Dashboard (opens in a new tab) ). \ud83d\udca1 We can securely store our API Keys in the BuildShip Secret Manager to maintain confidentiality and avoid misuse. Learn more (opens in a new tab) . For the System Prompt , let\u2019s add: `You're a ghost writer for ${ ctx[ 'root' ][ 'request' ][ 'body' ][ 'style' ] ?? 'Beatrix Potter' } , users give you prompts and you write short children story, in pages format,with short discription of an illustration to support the text,without mentioning the character names in the illustration text. Respond in json format{ \"cover\":{ \"title\":string, \"subtitle\":string, \"illustration\":string }, \"pages\":[ {index:number, \"illustration\":string, \"text\":string } ] } You are bedtime story teller. You will create: - A short bedtime stories that are meaningful, have a good moral, and creative - It should be safe for children to hear and no explicit content - No more than 6 pages - If you are unsure how to create a story say \"{\"error\":\"Sorry, I can't tell a story on that topic\"}. ` ; For the User Prompt , let\u2019s pass the incoming prompt from the HTTP Request Body. \ud83d\udca1 At any point, while building your BuildShip Workflow, we can use the Workflow and Node testing to check outputs and confirm the workflow is working correctly. Step 4: Parsing the JSON output Now we see that we get a stringified JSON object. Now to convert this into a JSON object we\u2019ll be using the Parse\nJSON node to do this. We can also test and ensure everything is working smoothly till this step. Step 5: Running flows in Parallel Now we need to: Generate the audio file for the story Generate the cover image for the storybook Both of these processes can be run in parallel. Let\u2019s add a Parallel Execution node. Now, let\u2019s discuss each of these\nprocesses one by one. PARALLEL PROCESS 1: Generating a Cover Image GENERATE IMAGE Firstly, we need a node to generate an image based on the prompt provided by the GPT Text Generator Node. \ud83d\udca1 If you search \u201cGenerate Image\u201d in the node explorer, you\u2019ll see BuildShip comes with a bunch of pre-built integration nodes for the same purpose - OpenAI DALL-E, StabilityAI Image Generator, Hugging Face Text to Image, Replicate Image Generation. You can use any of these pre-built nodes for generating the cover image. For this example, we\u2019ll be using the OpenAI Image Generator node using the DALL-E Model. Add in your API Key and\npick the DALL-E Model. For the Input Text, we\u2019ll be passing in the value for the cover.illustration from our Parsed\nOpenAI JSON. Pick a size. For this example, we\u2019ll be using 1024 X 1024. Clicking on the \u2139\ufe0f\u00a0icon on the Image Generator node reveals a node info section which tells us everything we need to\nknow about that node. This reveals that the generated output will be a Base64 file. SAVE BASE64 FILE Let\u2019s search the nodes featuring the Base64 format. We see we have two nodes: Upload Base64 file to BuildShip File Storage Upload Base64 file to Google Cloud Storage For this example, let\u2019s use the BuildShip File Storage node which requires no set-up. We\u2019ll be able to upload the Base64\nfile to a folder in the File Storage and returns the generated Public URL. \ud83d\udca1 We can also access the files via the BuildShip Storage Manager available in the Project Settings. For the * *Upload Base64 File - BuildShip Storage** node, add the output file from the OpenAI Image Generator node. For the file name, we\u2019ll need to add a unique name every time a story is generated. We can achieve this by adding a UUID\nGenerator node before the Parallel Execution , after the Parse JSON node. In the File Name input for the Upload Base64 File node, we can define the entire path for storing the Image file. For\nexample: Our flow to generate the cover image for the story. Now, let\u2019s build the parallel flow for generating the audio file for\nthe Storybook. PARALLEL PROCESS 2: Generating the Audio Storybook For generating the audio file for each of the story book page, we\u2019ll require a loop. This will loop over each page\u2019s\ntext, generate an audio file, and upload the file to the BuildShip File Storage in each iteration. ADDING A LOOP The Items input requires an array to loop through. Let\u2019s add the pages array from the parsed JSON input provided by\nOpenAI (from the Parse JSON node). CONVERT TEXT TO SPEECH Now, within the loop, we need to add the OpenAI Text to Speech node which will convert the story pages into audio page\nby page with every iteration. Add in the API Key and pick a model. The Input Text is the text for the current iteration page, i.e. item.text . SAVING THE AUDIO FILE TO STORAGE Once one iteration of the loop generates the audio it will output a Base64 file which we need to save to the BuildShip\nstorage. So, the audio file generated in every iteration is collected in a folder to be combined later. The Base64 File will be the output generated by the Text to Speech node for that iteration. Let\u2019s set the File Path to: Step 6: Formatting pages for the Storybook All we need to do now is to combine all of our generated data together. For this, we do not already have a pre-built\nnode in the library, so let\u2019s create it using the \u201c Generate with AI \u201d feature. Take the following prompt for example: I need a node that takes audioUrls array and pages array as input. It should iterate over the audioUrls array and, for each index, create a JSON object with properties - index - audio (value should be the audioUrl at the current index) - text (the text in the pages array at the same index) For the Audio URLs add in the output from the Loop node, and for Pages add the ParseJSON.pages as shown in\nthe Image below. Now, we can test the workflow and see if everything is working as expected and return the output as shown below: How to test an API? Now that we have built our workflow, let\u2019s test it out. We can test the workflow by clicking on the \u201c Test \u201d button on\nthe top right corner of the canvas. You can add in the Request inputs - Query Params, Headers, and Body. For this example, we'd only require the Body. Let's\nadd the following: { \"prompt\": \"Two siblings discover the hidden mysteries of an enchanted garden\", \"style\": \"Brothers Grimm\" } Now, let\u2019s click on the \u201c Run \u201d button to run the workflow. We can see the workflow running in real-time and the\noutput being generated. For every successful execution of a node, we can see a green tick mark. For any failed execution, we can see a red cross\nmark. We can also see the output generated by each node by clicking on the mark. How to ship an API? Now that we have built and tested our API, let\u2019s ship it. We can ship our API by clicking on the \u201c Ship \u201d button on\nthe top right corner of the canvas. It takes just a few seconds to complete the deployment process. Once the deployment is complete, we can see the API\nEndpoint URL in the pop-up. TIP\ud83d\udca1: We can also copy the API Endpoint URL from the link icon on top of the REST API Trigger node. This is the endpoint URL the HTTP request has to be directed to. The best part is that we can easily perform changes and hit the \u201c Ship \u201d button again to update the API. \u26a0\ufe0f The API will not be updated unless the \u201c Ship \u201d button is clicked. Also, any accidental changes made to the API will\nnot be reflected until the \u201c Ship \u201d button is clicked. Also, every time we ship an API, a new version is created. We can see all the versions of the API in the \u201c Version\nHistory \u201d tab next to the Ship Button. (This is only available for paid plans) How to use an API? Now that we have shipped our API, let\u2019s see how we can use it. We can use the API Endpoint URL in any of our apps, be it\na low-code app or a custom app. All we need to do is hit the API Endpoint URL with the required inputs. You can pick any programming language, HTTP\nlibrary or framework to make the API call. Common choices include requests in Python, axios in JavaScript, or libraries in other languages. For testing purposes,\nyou can use Postman (opens in a new tab) , HoppScotch (opens in a new tab) or Insomnia (opens in a new tab) . Making API requests Use the chosen HTTP library to make requests to the API endpoints. Include any required parameters, headers, and\nauthentication tokens. Example in Python using requests : import requests url = \"https://xyz.buildship.run/post_endpoint\" headers = { \"Content-Type\" : \"application/json\" , \"Authorization\" : \"Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\" } # Dummy data data = { \"name\" : \"John Doe\" , \"email\" : \"john.doe@example.com\" , \"age\" : 30 } # Making a POST request response = requests . post (url, json = data, headers = headers) # Handling the response if response . status_code == 201 : # Assuming a successful creation status code result = response . json () print ( \"Post successful. Result:\" , result) else : print ( f \"Error: { response.status_code } \" ) Example in JavaScript using axios : const axios = require ( 'axios' ); const url = 'https://xyz.buildship.run/post_endpoint' ; const headers = { 'Content-Type' : 'application/json' , Authorization : 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' , }; // Dummy data const data = { name : 'John Doe' , email : 'john.doe@example.com' , age : 30 , }; // Making a POST request with axios axios .post (url , data , { headers }) .then ((response) => { console .log ( 'Post successful. Result:' , response .data); }) .catch ((error) => { console .error ( 'Error:' , error .message); }); Example in JavaScript using fetch : const url = 'https://xyz.buildship.run/post_endpoint' ; const headers = { 'Content-Type' : 'application/json' , Authorization : 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' , }; // Dummy data const data = { name : 'John Doe' , email : 'john.doe@example.com' , age : 30 , }; // Making a POST request with fetch fetch (url , { method : 'POST' , headers : headers , body : JSON .stringify (data) , }) .then ((response) => { if ( ! response .ok) { throw new Error ( `HTTP error! Status: ${ response .status } ` ); } return response .json (); }) .then ((result) => { console .log ( 'Post successful. Result:' , result); }) .catch ((error) => { console .error ( 'Error:' , error .message); }); Need Help? \ud83d\udcac Join BuildShip Community An active and large community of no-code / low-code builders.

Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 Trigger Nodes Scheduled Cron Scheduled Cron Trigger The Scheduled Cron Trigger node is a powerful tool within BuildShip that enables you to automate workflows based on\nscheduled time intervals . This trigger allows you to initiate workflows at specific times , or patterns, ensuring\ntimely execution of your automation tasks. User Friendly Cron Triggers \u23f0 BuildShip offers a 4 user-friendly cron triggers which let you schedule workflows to run at specific intervals , like\nevery day, every hour, every month, and every week. No need to set up complex cron expressions, just choose the\ndesired interval and time zone . Learn more: Every Day: Schedule a workflow to run every day at a specified time, like 5 pm every day. \u2192 Every Hour: Schedule a workflow to run every hour for more frequent automation. \u2192 Every Month: Schedule a workflow to run at a specific time on chosen days of the month, such as the 1st and 15th at midnight. \u2192 Every Week: Schedule a workflow to run at a specific time on chosen days of the week, like every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at noon. \u2192 How to Use Scheduled Cron Trigger The Scheduled Cron Trigger node comes with three essential fields that you need to configure: Location : The GCP region where the trigger will be executed . This field is automatically filled based on the\nGCP region associated with your workspace. Schedule : Set the schedule pattern using the cron syntax . This field determines the frequency and timing of\nyour workflow execution. For example, */20 * * * * specifies an interval of 20 minutes. \ud83d\udca1 Discover additional information about cron syntax and creating custom cron expressions here . Time Zone : Choose the desired time zone for your scheduled trigger . You can select from the list of existing\ntime zones. Understanding the Cron Syntax CRON syntax is a widely used standard for scheduling tasks in various Unix-like operating systems. It defines a set\nof fields that specify when a task should be executed based on time intervals. Each field represents a unit of time, allowing users to define intricate scheduling patterns . The CRON syntax consists of five fields, each separated by a space: Minute (0 - 59) : Specifies the minute at which the task should run. A value of * indicates any minute, while 0\nindicates the exact minute. Hour (0 - 23) : Specifies the hour at which the task should run. A value of * indicates any hour, while 0\nindicates midnight. Day of Month (1 - 31) : Specifies the day of the month when the task should run. A value of * indicates any day,\nwhile specific numbers represent particular days. Month (1 - 12) : Specifies the month when the task should run. A value of * indicates any month, while specific\nnumbers represent particular months. Day of Week (0 - 6) : Specifies the day of the week when the task should run. The values 0 and 7 often represent\nSunday, 1 represents Monday, and so on. The CRON syntax also supports special characters and shorthand notations: */x : Represents every x interval. For example, */15 in the minutes field means every 15 minutes. x-y : Represents a range of values. For example, 1-5 in the day of week field means Monday to Friday. x,y,z : Represents a list of values. For example, 1,15 in the day of month field means the 1st and 15th day. \u2705 EXAMPLE 1: Suppose you want to schedule a task to run every day at 3:30 PM. The CRON expression for this scenario would be: 30 15 * * * Minute (30) : The task should run at the 30th minute of the hour. Hour (15) : The task should run at the 15th hour, which is 3:00 PM in 24-hour format. Day of Month (*) : The task should run on any day of the month. Month (*) : The task should run in any month. Day of Week (*) : The task should run on any day of the week. \u2705 EXAMPLE 2: Suppose you want to schedule a task to run every weekday (Monday to Friday) at 9:00 AM. The CRON expression for this scenario would be: 0 9 * * 1-5 Minute (0) : The task should run at the 0th minute of the hour. Hour (9) : The task should run at the 9th hour, which is 9:00 AM. Day of Month (*) : The task should run on any day of the month. Month (*) : The task should run in any month. Day of Week (1-5) : The task should run on Monday to Friday. Setting up the Scheduled Cron Trigger To set up a Scheduled Cron Trigger within your BuildShip workflow, follow these steps: Add Trigger Node Create a new workflow or open an existing one. Click \"Add Trigger\" and select \"Scheduled Cron\" from the available\ntrigger options. Configure Fields Configure the fields within the Scheduled Cron Trigger node. You can choose the desired GCP region, schedule pattern,\nand time zone for your trigger as given in the above sections. \ud83e\uddbe Use Cases for Scheduled Interval Trigger Example 1: Daily Backup CRON Expression : 0 0 * * * Description : This expression triggers the workflow every day at midnight. It's perfect for automating daily backups of your data. Example 2: Weekly Reports CRON Expression : 0 8 * * 1 Description : This expression triggers the workflow every Monday at 8:00 AM. It's great for generating weekly reports at the start of the workweek. Need Help? \ud83d\udcac Join BuildShip Community An active and large community of no-code / low-code builders.

Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 Trigger Nodes Rowy Trigger Rowy Trigger Rowy Triggers in BuildShip allow you to initiate a BuildShip workflow in response to specific events within your Rowy\nProject. This integration enables you to automate tasks seamlessly based on events that occur in your Rowy environment. \ud83d\ude80 This method also acts as a Firebase Trigger , allowing you to efficiently manage your Firebase Data with both Rowy\nand BuildShip. Pre-requisites \u2705 For this integration to work, you will need: A Rowy Project with a Rowy Run set up. If you don't have a Rowy Project, you can create one here (opens in a new tab) . Configuration in BuildShip Add a Rowy Trigger After creating a new workflow in BuildShip, click on Add a Trigger and select Rowy Trigger from the available options. Add in your Rowy Project ID In the Project ID field add your Rowy Project ID. Click on the link icon on the top right within the trigger to copy the\nconfiguration details required for the next steps. \ud83d\udc40 To get your Rowy Project ID, go to your Rowy Table and click on your profile picture on the top right. You'll find the Project ID under the your Email Id. This is all you need to do in BuildShip to set up the Rowy Trigger. Now, let's set up the BuildShip Extension our Rowy\nTable. Setting up the Rowy Extension Add the BuildShip Extension In your Rowy Table, access the extensions menu and add a \" BuildShip Trigger Extension \". Select Trigger Events Choose the specific events within Rowy that will trigger the BuildShip extension. You can select from events: Create Update Delete Specify Required Fields (Optional) Optionally, you can define the required fields that must be populated to trigger the extension. Set Trigger Conditions (Optional) If needed, add conditions that determine whether the extension should be triggered for a given row. Configure BuildShip Trigger Within the extension body, navigate to the return statement. You'll find the \"buildshipConfig\" object, which includes\nthe following fields: buildshipConfig : { projectId : \"\" , workflowId : \"\" } Replace the placeholder with the configuration details copied from your BuildShip Rowy Trigger. It should look something\nlike this: buildshipConfig : { projectId : \"buildship-008vd0\" , workflowId : \"zE49cCs5kBmg7GkUwzLt\" } Save and Deploy Once you've configured the extension to your requirements, click on \"Add\" and then deploy the extension. Now, whenever the selected event (Create, Update, or Delete) occurs in your Rowy Table, it will trigger the BuildShip\nworkflow linked to this extension. The Request Structure When the BuildShip Workflow is triggered via the Rowy Extension, it passes the following request body structure: This body structure can then be referenced in different parts of the workflow as variables. Updating Rowy Table with the API Response Once you've configured your Rowy Trigger and the BuildShip Extension on Rowy, let's explore how to update fields or\nadd a row in our Rowy table from our BuildShip Workflow using an example. In this scenario, we have a Rowy Table containing a list of items. The BuildShip Extension triggers the connected\nBuildShip Workflow every time a new item is added or updated. The triggered workflow employs OpenAI\u2019s GPT Model to generate an adjective to describe each item and updates the\nadjective column in the Rowy Table accordingly. To implement this, after setting up the Rowy Extension and Trigger mechanism, proceed to add an OpenAI Text Generator\nnode. Add your OpenAI API Key (opens in a new tab) . Set the User Prompt to Row.item . Define the System Prompt as follows: Generate a unique adjective for a given item. Provide only one word. To update the Rowy Table with the generated adjective, utilize the Update Firestore Field Value node. This node updates the Firestore Collection associated with your Rowy project , thereby reflecting changes in the Rowy Table. \ud83d\udca1 NOTE: To utilize the Firebase/Firestore nodes and connect to your Firebase project, follow the step-by-step guide to\ninitiate the connection here . In the Update Firestore Field Value node: Enter the same Project ID used in the Rowy Trigger. Set the Document Path input to the variable Body > Ref > Path . Define the Field Key as adjective (for this example). Pass the output of the OpenAI Text Generator node into the **New Value(()) input. \u26a0\ufe0f The Return node does not update the Rowy Table or returns any values in this case as the BuildShip Extension doesn't support returning values to the Rowy Table. The Update Firestore Field Value node has to be used to update the Rowy Table with the response values.

Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 Trigger Nodes Telegram Bot Telegram Bot Trigger The Telegram Bot is a handy trigger within BuildShip that enables you to handle incoming messages in Telegram chats. This trigger allows you to easily manage Telegram Bot, moderate and respond with meaningful messages and even include\nOpenAI in your workflow to generate meaningful responses to assist users. Create a bot and share it with your users to\ndirectly interact with your Telegram Bot and get responses. Pre-requisites \u2705 Telegram bot API key - The API keys of the Telegram bot that will be responding to the incoming messages. To\nsetup a bot and get the API key, follow the instructions here . How to setup a Telegram bot and get API key Enter @BotFather in the search tab and select the verified bot with tick mark that shows up. Click Start to activate the BotFather bot. You will receive a list of commands to manage the bots. Choose or type the /newbot command and click Send. Choose a name for your bot. Your subscribers will see it in their conversations. Next, choose a username for your\nbot. The bot can be found by its username in the search bar. The username must be unique and end with the word \u201cbot.\u201d Once you've made your selection for your bot's name, your bot will be brought to life. Shortly thereafter, you'll\nreceive a message containing a link leading to your bot, which can be accessed at \"t.me/[bot_username] as well as\nyour API key. Make note of this API key as this is what you will need to use in the Telegram Trigger node on BuildShip. Clone the Telegram Bot Assistant Template Clone this template to get started with the Telegram Bot by just adding your token. Search Telegram Bot and publish it to Telegram and share with users Search for @userdetailsbot on telegram to get your personl UID. Add the UID generated by Userinfo | Get id bot in the chat ID of the Send Telegram Messaging Node. (optional if using\nfrom the template - the ID is passed as variable from the trigger response) Search for your created Bot on Telegram and click start. Start chatting with your Bot. Step to create a Telegram Bot workflow manually Add the Telegram Bot Trigger Add the telegram bot's API Key, that you can get from this step . Also,\noptionally you can add a Verification Code if you want incoming requests to be verified. Verification Code (optional) Telegram Bot API provides a verification code to ensure requests to your bot's webhook are coming from Telegram itself.\nThis code is a random string sent in the X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token header with each update request. You can use\nthis code to verify that the request is coming from Telegram and not from a third-party source. If you want to use this\nfeature, you can generate a random string and add it to the Verification Code field in the Telegram Bot Trigger node.\nThis code will be sent in the X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token header with each update request to your bot's webhook. You\ncan then verify this code in your workflow to ensure the request is coming from Telegram. To set the verification code, you can add the code in the Verification Code field in the Telegram Bot Trigger node and\nsend it to the headers of te incoming request to your webhook. To know more about Telegram Bot verification code you can\nrefer to this link (opens in a new tab) . Add \"Send Telegram message\" Node Next to you workflow, add a node by searching in the node explorer for \"Send Telegram message\" node to reply to\nincoming messages. Add the \"Chat ID\" of the group that you want the bot to reply to. (Use the Telegram Assistant Template to skip adding\nthe ChatID (and fetch it dynamically from the Trigger Response)) To this node also add the response \"Text\" that you want the bot to reply with. We have added here, a generic message\nof \"Welcome to the group...\". You can however, add nodes like OpenAI text generation to respond with AI, or even verify if the incoming message is\nfrom a Stripe paying user before responding There is full flexibiliy to add more nodes and handle what your bot is replying with. Return success status and click Ship Finally, add a \"Return\" node that will respond with a success status. And click the \"Ship\" button to deploy the workflow Send a message to Test Finally, you can send a message and test the response is as expected. That's it \ud83c\udf89 \ud83d\udca1 Use the Telegram Bot Assistant to create a Telegram Bot workflow without the need to add the Chat ID manually and\nstart by just setting up the bot and passing the access token. customers.

The BuildShip Trigger Question? Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 Trigger Nodes Buildship Trigger BuildShip Trigger The BuildShip Trigger serves as a mechanism to initiate a BuildShip Workflow from another workflow by employing the Execute Workflow node. This functionality enables users to trigger workflows within the same project or across different projects. TIP \ud83d\udca1: An alternative method to accomplish this is through the API Call Node available in the Node Library. Understanding the Mechanism 1. Execute Workflow Node This node is added to the primary workflow and serves the purpose of initiating the secondary workflow. 2. BuildShip Trigger This is integrated into the secondary workflow, which is intended to be triggered. Execute Workflow Node The Execute Workflow Node empowers users to trigger any workflow, regardless of whether it belongs to the same or a\ndifferent project. For the Execute Workflow Node, the following information is required: Project ID (optional) When executing a BuildShip Workflow that isn't part of the current project, users must specify the Project ID . This ID can be found within the BuildShip Trigger Config or in the BuildShip Project Settings page. Workflow ID The Workflow ID is necessary to identify the workflow to be invoked. Users can retrieve this ID from the BuildShip\nTrigger config or copy it from the address bar. The Workflow ID is the last part of the URL, as shown below: https://buildship.app/p/project-id/workflow/workflow-id Data This input allows users to pass data to another workflow as the request body. The data format is expected to be in the\nform of a JSON object. Sample Data Object: { \"name\" : \"John Doe\" , \"age\" : 30 , \"city\" : \"New York\" } Await? This boolean input determines whether the triggered secondary workflow needs to complete before proceeding with the\nremaining nodes in the primary workflow. The BuildShip Trigger To complete this mechanism, users need to include the BuildShip Trigger Node in the secondary workflow intended to be\ninitiated via the Execute Workflow node. The BuildShip Trigger node processes incoming trigger requests from the \" Execute Workflow \" node, validating the\nsource and authenticating it. If calling the target workflow from a different BuildShip Project (other than the one housing the target workflow),\nusers need to specify the Runtime Service Account from the other project. This information can be obtained from the\nProject Settings page within BuildShip. If the user needs to call the target workflow from a different BuildShip Project (other than the one with the target\nworkflow), users need to specify the Runtime Service Account of other project (one with the \" Execute Workflow \"\nNode). The BuildShip Runtime Service Account can be obtained from the Project Settings page. The data passed through the Execute Workflow node can be accessed in the target workflow using the Data variable from\nthe context menu in the Input Editor.

Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 Trigger Nodes Firebase Auth Request Firebase Auth Request Trigger The Firebase Authenticated Request Trigger facilitates seamless API Calls to BuildShip from a Web Client. Leveraging the\nuser's ID token as the authentication key, it automatically rejects unauthenticated requests, ensuring robust security\nmeasures. This mechanism ensures that only authenticated users of your application can send requests to your API endpoint. Prerequisites \u2705 A Frontend Application / Web Client integrated with Firebase Authentication . Users must pass the end-user's ID\ntoken in the headers to authenticate the request. Understanding the Mechanism This trigger functions similar to the REST API Call Trigger . It allows you to specify the Path of the API Endpoint and the HTTP Method for the incoming request. The Request Structure is outlined below: Request Method The HTTP Method for the incoming request can be specified in the Firebase Authenticated Request Trigger configuration.\nThe supported methods are GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Request Headers The request headers must include the Authorization Header , where the value should be the user\u2019s ID Token received\npost successful user authentication within your Web Client. Additionally, the Content-Type should be set to application/json . For more details about Firebase ID Tokens, refer to the documentation here (opens in a new tab) . \ud83d\udca1 For testing purposes, users can conveniently copy and paste their token from the network tab. SAMPLE INPUT : Authorization: 'Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZC...', 'Content-Type': 'application/json' Request Body For HTTP Methods like POST , and PUT , users have the option to pass any desired data to be accessed within the\nWorkflow associated with the Firebase Auth Trigger. This data format must adhere to a JSON Object . SAMPLE INPUT : { \"key1\": \"value1\", \"key2\": \"value2\" } Here\u2019s an example demonstrating a similar request using the API Call Node in BuildShip. However, for actual\nimplementation, this request must be made through the client application. The Firebase Authenticated Request Trigger In a blank workflow, click on \u201c Add Trigger \u201d button and select the \u201c Firebase Authenticated Request \u201d trigger. The Project ID , Path , and Method inputs are required for configuring the trigger for your project. Firebase Project ID Users must specify the Firebase Project ID utilized by their client application . This trigger initializes\nauthentication and validates the token passed in the request. If no Project ID is provided, the Trigger employs the default Project ID linked with your BuildShip Project. Path The Path specifies the endpoint where the incoming request is directed. This can be any valid URL path, such as /users , /products , or /orders . Method The Method input specifies the HTTP Method for the incoming request. The supported methods are GET, POST, PUT, and\nDELETE. Trigger Outputs Once the trigger is correctly configured, users will be able to access the Request Body passed via the POST Request made\nto the endpoint, along with the Firebase User details. The Firebase User Details include the Display Name, Photo URL, Email, and UID. All these outputs can be accessed as variables using the Context Menu in the Editor. Example Workflow Consider a scenario where we aim to generate custom tokens for users whose emails end with a specific domain, such as @buildship.com . Let's outline the steps for achieving this: Firebase Authenticated Request Trigger Add the Project ID associated with the client that authenticates the user and generates the ID Token. Branch Node Set up a Branch node in the workflow to evaluate whether the Firestore User Email includes @buildship.com. Paste the\nfollowing condtion in the Editor: ctx[\"root\"][\"firebase-trigger\"][\"user\"][\"email\"].includes(\"@buildship.com\") Conditional Workflow Execution If the user's email matches the condition ( @buildship.com ), proceed with generating a custom Firebase Token for the\nuser's UID. If the condition is not met, return a response with a status code of 401 - Unauthorized Request. This workflow ensures that only users with email addresses ending in @buildship.com receive custom Firebase Tokens,\nallowing controlled access to specific functionalities or resources within the application.

Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 Trigger Nodes Rest API File Upload Rest API File Upload Trigger The Rest API File Upload Trigger is designed to handle incoming HTTP requests with multipart/form-data content type,\nwhich is commonly used for file uploads. When a request is sent to the specified endpoint, the trigger parses the request body and extracts the uploaded file\nalong with its metadata. The file is then stored in a buffer, which can be used for further processing or storage. Input Request Structure The Upload File Trigger allows you to specify a Path and Method for the trigger. The Path is the URL\nendpoint where the trigger will listen for incoming requests. The Method is the HTTP method that the trigger will\nlisten for. The trigger expects an HTTP request with the following structure: Content-Type: multipart/form-data Method: POST or PUT Body: The request body should contain the file data and any additional form fields. The request body is parsed using the multer library, which is a middleware for handling multipart/form-data in\nNode.js. Output The trigger produces the following output which can be used in subsequent workflow nodes: file: An object containing the uploaded file and its metadata, including: fieldname : The name of the field containing the file in the form data. originalname : The original name of the file on the user's computer. mimetype : The MIME type of the file. buffer : A Buffer (Node.js) containing the entire file data. size : The size of the file in bytes. encoding : The encoding type of the file. body: An object containing any additional form fields submitted with the request. headers: An object containing the request headers. Usage Here's a basic template that can be cloned and used as a starting point. This example demonstrates how to use the File\nUpload Trigger to handle incoming file uploads and save the file to the BuildShip Cloud Storage to get back a public\nURL. ( Click here to clone the template in your project! (opens in a new tab) ) \u2b50\ufe0f Testing the Trigger You can test the Rest API File Upload Trigger using tools like Postman or Hoppscotch. Here's an example of how to test\nit using Postman: Open Postman and create a new request. Set the request method to POST or PUT . Copy the endpoint URL from the Trigger's Instructions popover and paste it in the request URL field. Set the request body type to form-data . Click the \"Choose File\" button and select the file you want to upload. If you have additional form fields, you can add them under the \"form-data\" section. Click the \"Send\" button to submit the request. If the request is successful, you should see the response from the workflow containing the public URL of the file.

Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 Trigger Nodes Rest API File Upload (Auth) Rest API File Upload (Auth) Trigger The Authenticated Rest API File Upload Trigger is designed to handle incoming HTTP requests with multipart/form-data\ncontent type, which is commonly used for file uploads. However, before processing the file upload, the trigger verifies if the request is coming from an authenticated user by\nchecking the Authorization header for a valid Firebase ID token. If the token is valid, the trigger proceeds to parse the request body and extract the uploaded file along with its\nmetadata. The file is then stored in a buffer, which can be used for further processing or storage. \ud83d\udca1 If you're looking for a more general-purpose file upload trigger without verification, you can use the Rest API File\nUpload Trigger instead. Input Request Structure The Upload File Trigger allows you to specify a Path , Method , and a Project ID for the trigger. The Path is the URL endpoint where the trigger will listen for incoming requests. The Method is the HTTP method that the\ntrigger will listen for. The Project ID is the ID of the Firebase project that the trigger will use to verify the ID\ntoken. Leave empty to use default project associated with your BuildShip Workspace. The trigger expects an HTTP request with the following structure: Content-Type: multipart/form-data Method: POST or PUT Headers: The request should contain an Authorization header with a valid Firebase ID token. Body: The request body should contain the file data and any additional form fields. The request body is parsed using the multer library, which is a middleware for handling multipart/form-data in\nNode.js. Output The trigger produces the following output: file: An object containing the uploaded file and its metadata, including: fieldname : The name of the field containing the file in the form data. originalname : The original name of the file on the user's computer. mimetype : The MIME type of the file. buffer : A Buffer (Node.js) containing the entire file data. size : The size of the file in bytes. encoding : The encoding type of the file. body: An object containing any additional form fields submitted with the request. headers: An object containing the request headers. Authentication Before processing the file upload, the trigger verifies the provided Firebase ID token by calling the verifyIdToken method from the Firebase Admin SDK. If the token is valid, the trigger proceeds with the file upload process. If the\ntoken is invalid or missing, an error is thrown with an \"Unauthorized request\" message. \ud83d\udca1 The Authenticated Rest API File Upload Trigger is designed to verify the Firebase ID token before processing the file\nupload. Learn more on how to add the Firebase ID token to the request (or for testing) in the Firebase Authentication\nTrigger > Request Headers . Usage Here's a basic template that can be cloned and used as a starting point. This example demonstrates how to use the\nAuthenticated Rest API File Upload Trigger to verify and handle incoming file uploads and save the file to the BuildShip\nCloud Storage to get back a public URL.\n( Click here to clone the template in your project! (opens in a new tab) )\n\u2b50\ufe0f Testing You can test the Authenticated Rest API File Upload Trigger using tools like Postman or Hoppscotch. Here's an example of\nhow to test it using Postman: Open Postman and create a new request. Set the request method to POST or PUT . Enter the endpoint URL in the request URL field. In the \"Headers\" tab, add a new header with the key \"Authorization\" and the value Bearer <Firebase ID Token> .\nReplace <Firebase ID Token> with a valid Firebase ID token for an authenticated user. In the Body tab, select the form-data option. Click the \"Choose File\" button and select the file you want to upload. If you have additional form fields, you can add them under the \"form-data\" section. Click the \"Send\" button to submit the request. If the request is successful and the provided Firebase ID token is valid, you should see the response from the trigger\ncontaining the file buffer and metadata. If the token is invalid or missing, you should see an \"Unauthorized request\"\nerror. Need Help? \ud83d\udcac Join BuildShip Community An active and large community of no-code / low-code builders.

Using this trigger, you can activate specific workflows in response to various webhook events that occur within your\nLemon Squeezy account , such as new orders, subscription updates, or license key changes. Prerequisites \u2705 Before configuring the Lemon Squeezy Trigger, you need to have the following: API Key The Lemon Squeezy API Key. You can create an API Key from the Lemon Squeezy Dashboard by navigating to Settings > API (opens in a new tab) . Store ID The ID of the store for which you want to set up the webhook. You can find your Store ID from the Settings > Stores (opens in a new tab) section in the Lemon Squeezy Dashboard. Secret Key A string used by Lemon Squeezy to sign requests for increased security. This key is required for verifying the\nauthenticity of the incoming requests. \ud83d\udca1 NOTE: The Secret Key needs to have a length greater than or equal to 6 characters. Trigger Inputs The Lemon Squeezy Trigger requires the following input parameters to be configured: API Key Your Lemon Squeezy API Key. You can create an API Key from the Lemon Squeezy Dashboard by navigating to Settings > API (opens in a new tab) . (Refer to the prerequisites section for\nmore information) Events The specific events that will trigger the associated BuildShip Workflow. You can choose to listen to all events by\nleaving this field empty, or you can specify a list of events to listen to. The available events include: Event Name Description order_created Occurs when a new order is successfully placed. order_refunded Occurs when a full or partial refund is made on an order. subscription_created Occurs when a new subscription is successfully created. An order_created event will always be sent alongside a subscription_created event. subscription_updated Occurs when a subscription's data is changed or updated. This event can be used as a \"catch-all\" to make sure you always have access to the latest subscription data. subscription_cancelled Occurs when a subscription is cancelled manually by the customer or store owner. The subscription enters a \"grace period\" until the next billing date, when it will expire. It is possible for the subscription to be resumed during this period. subscription_resumed Occurs when a subscription is resumed after being previously cancelled. subscription_expired Occurs when a subscription has ended after being previously cancelled, or once dunning has been completed for past_due subscriptions. You can manage how long to wait before the system marks deliquent subscriptions as expired. subscription_paused Occurs when a subscription's payment collection is paused. subscription_unpaused Occurs when a subscription's payment collection is resumed after being previously paused. subscription_payment_success Occurs when a subscription payment is successful. subscription_payment_failed Occurs when a subscription renewal payment fails. subscription_payment_recovered Occurs when a subscription has a successful payment after a failed payment. A subscription_payment_success event will always be sent alongside a subscription_payment_recovered event. subscription_payment_refunded Occurs when a subscription payment is refunded. license_key_created Occurs when a license key is created from a new order. An order_created event will always be sent alongside a license_key_created event. license_key_updated Occurs when a license key is updated. Secret Key The string used by Lemon Squeezy to sign requests for increased security. This key is required for verifying the\nauthenticity of the incoming requests. Store ID The ID of the store for which you want to set up the webhook. This ID should match the Store ID you obtained from the\nSettings > Stores section in the Lemon Squeezy Dashboard. (Refer to the prerequisites section for\nmore information) Trigger Outputs Once the trigger is correctly configured and shipped, users will be able to access the following outputs: Parsed Payload: The parsed JSON payload of the incoming webhook event. Raw Payload: The raw, unparsed payload of the incoming webhook event. These outputs can be accessed as variables using the Context Menu in the BuildShip Editor. Webhook Security The Lemon Squeezy Trigger uses HMAC-SHA256 signatures to ensure the authenticity of incoming webhook requests. The\nprovided Secret Key is used to validate the signature included in the request headers. This mechanism ensures that only\nlegitimate requests from Lemon Squeezy are processed by the trigger, enhancing the overall security of your workflows. Example Use Cases Use Cases The Lemon Squeezy Trigger can be utilized in various scenarios to automate and streamline your workflows. Here\nare some interesting use cases: Order Processing: Configure the trigger to listen for the order_created or order_refunded events, and then\ncreate a workflow to automatically update your inventory management system, send order confirmation emails, or\ninitiate shipment processes. Subscription Management: Set up the trigger to respond to subscription_created , subscription_updated , subscription_cancelled , or other subscription-related events, and create workflows to sync subscription data with\nyour billing system, send notifications to customers, or trigger marketing campaigns based on subscription changes.

With this trigger, you can easily integrate RevenueCat's clean, normalized subscription data into your BuildShip\nworkflows, enabling you to automate processes and build custom workflows every time there are changes to subscriptions,\nand purchases. Prerequisites \u2705 Before setting up the RevenueCat Trigger, you'll need: A RevenueCat Account. You can sign up for a RevenueCat account here (opens in a new tab) . Setting up the RevenueCat Trigger Add the RevenueCat Trigger Create a new workflow, click on \"Add Trigger\" button to open the Trigger Explorer . Pick the RevenueCat Trigger from the list of available triggers. Click on Add to add it to your workflow. Set up the RevenueCat Webhook Go to the RevenueCat Dashboard (opens in a new tab) Navigate to Projects and click on your current project. Under Integrations , click on Add Integration . Under RevenueCat core tools > Click on Webhooks and create a new Webhook. Configure the Webhook Add a Webhook Name - any name to identify the webhook. Add the Webhook URL - the URL generated by the RevenueCat Trigger in BuildShip. \ud83d\udca1 To get the Webhook URL, go to the RevenueCat Trigger in your BuildShip workflow and click on the URL icon to copy\nthe Endpoint URL. Set the Authorization Header Value (optional) - To enable verification for the webhook requests, add a secret\nvalue to match in the RevenueCat Trigger Auth Token . If no value is set, the webhook will be sent without any\nauthorization. (Refer to the Trigger Inputs section for more information) Choose the environment to trigger the webhook - Sandbox or Production . Select Events Choose the events you want to trigger the webhook for. You can choose to trigger the webhook for all events or\nindividually select from the following: Initial purchase - A new subscription has been purchased, or a lapsed user has resubscribed. Renewal - An existing subscription has been renewed. Product change - A customer has changed the product of their subscription. Cancellation - A subscription or non-renewing purchase has been canceled. Billing issue - There has been a problem trying to charge the subscriber. Non-renewing purchase - A customer has made a purchase that will not auto-renew. Uncancellation - A non-expired canceled subscription has been re-enabled. Transfer - A transfer of transactions and entitlements was initiated between one App User ID(s) to another. Subscription paused - The subscription has been set to be paused at the end of the period. Expiration - A subscription has expired. Subscription extended - A subscription has been extended. Invoice issuance - An invoice has been issued. Temporary entitlement grant - An entitlement has been granted temporarily to a customer. Trigger Inputs The RevenueCat Trigger requires the following input parameters to be configured: Auth Token The Auth Token is an optional secret value that can be set in the RevenueCat Webhook configuration to verify the\nauthenticity of the incoming requests. If you set an Auth Token in the RevenueCat Webhook, you need to provide the same\nvalue in the Auth Token field of the RevenueCat Trigger in BuildShip. \ud83d\udca1 If there is no Auth Token set in the RevenueCat Webhook, you'll need to leave this field empty. Usage Once the RevenueCat Trigger is set up and configured, it will verify and parse the Webhook payload coming from the\nevents you've signed up for. The trigger will return the following output: request : An object containing the query , headers , and body of the incoming webhook request. output : The parsed payload from the RevenueCat webhook request body. You can use this output to further process the RevenueCat webhook data in your BuildShip workflow, enabling you to build\ncustom automations and integrations based on subscription events. It can be used to automate workflows based on the events triggered by RevenueCat. For example, you can create a workflow\nthat sends an email notification to the customer when their subscription is about to expire, or update a database with\nthe latest subscription data whenever a renewal event is triggered.

Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 Trigger Nodes MongoDB Trigger MongoDB Trigger The MongoDB Trigger parses the incoming webhook payload from the MongoDB webhook triggers. In other words, the\nBuildShip Workflow runs every time there are any changes in the linked MongoDB Collection, Database, or Deployment .\nAlternatively, the workflow can also be made to run based on a given schedule (or a CRON expression); however, this\ndocumentation is for setting up a Database Trigger. Prerequisites \u2705 A MongoDB Project. If you don't have one set up, click here (opens in a new tab) to set one up. Adding MongoDB Trigger Create a new BuildShip Workflow and click on the \" Add Trigger \" button. Select (or search for) the MongoDB\nTrigger and add it to the workflow. Open the Instruction panel \ud83d\udcce and copy the Webhook URL . To test the MongoDB Trigger functionality, click on the \" Add Node \" button and search for the Log message to console node and add it to the workflow. For the input values, pass in the Request Body from the\ncontext menu. Hit \" Ship! \ud83d\ude80\". Read the following section to complete the testing setup. Setting up the MongoDB Trigger Navigate to your MongoDB Dashboard and navigate to the \" Triggers \" section. Pick your desired type of trigger from Database - which will listen to changes to your database, or Scheduled - which will trigger the event at the chosen schedule. For this example, we will be setting up a Database Trigger . Follow the instructions and set up your source details. Under the Function section, select \" Function \" as the Event Type. Inside the Function script editor, paste the following script. Copy the Webhook URL from the MongoDB Trigger in\nyour BuildShip workflow, and paste it on line 5 : import axios from 'axios' ; import crypto from 'crypto' ; exports = async function (changeEvent) { const webhookUrl = '' ; // Add your webhook URL here const workflowId = webhookUrl .split ( '/' ) .pop (); try { const signature = generateSignature (changeEvent , workflowId); const res = await axios .post (webhookUrl , changeEvent , { headers : { 'X-Webhook-Signature' : signature , } , }); console .log ( JSON .stringify (changeEvent)); return true ; } catch (error) { console .error ( 'Error sending webhook:' , error); return false ; } }; function generateSignature (data , secret) { const hmac = crypto .createHmac ( 'sha256' , secret); hmac .update ( JSON .stringify (data)); return hmac .digest ( 'hex' ); } Click on the \" Add Dependency \" button and add axios , then hit \" Add \". This will install the dependency for the\nfunction execution. Similarly, add a dependency for the crypto package. Once this is done, click on the \" \u25b6\ufe0e Run \" button at the bottom. If set up correctly, this should return true as\nthe output on the console. \ud83d\udca1 The code snippet uses the axios library to send the POST request to the webhook URL, and the crypto library to\ngenerate a signature for the webhook payload. The signature is included in the request headers to ensure the\nauthenticity of the request . Troubleshooting If you encounter any issues while setting up the MongoDB Trigger, here are some common troubleshooting tips: Double-check the Webhook URL: Ensure that you've copied the correct Webhook URL from BuildShip and pasted it into\nthe MongoDB Function script. Verify dependencies: Make sure you've added the required axios and crypto dependencies to the MongoDB\nFunction. Review the logs: Check the MongoDB Function logs for any error messages or helpful information that can assist in\ntroubleshooting.

When you add a YouTube Trigger to your\nworkflow, you will be prompted to authenticate with your Google account and grant the necessary permissions to the\ntrigger. \ud83d\udca1 To use the YouTube Trigger, you need to make sure you are neccessary permissions to manage the associated YouTube\nchannel . Trigger Inputs The YouTube Trigger requires the following inputs: Channel URL The URL of the YouTube channel that you want to monitor for new video uploads. It's a required field, and you need\nto provide a valid YouTube channel URL. SAMPLE INPUT: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1_8S7ffEDaOjcnjWOlRRlg Track Frequency The frequency at which the trigger should check for new video uploads . You can choose from the following options: Every 5 minutes Every 15 minutes Every 30 minutes Every 60 minutes Every 6 hours Every 12 hours Every 24 hours Every 5 days Every 15 days Every 30 days Trigger Outputs The YouTube Trigger returns an output object containing the following properties: New Videos newVideos is an array of new videos detected on the monitored YouTube channel since the last execution of the\ntrigger. The newVideos array contains objects with the following properties: id (string): The ID of the video. url (string): The URL of the video. title (string): The title of the video. description (string): The description of the video. publishedAt (string): The date and time when the video was published (in ISO format). thumbnail (string): The URL of the video's thumbnail image. Snapshot snapshot is an object representing the current state of the monitored YouTube channel , including the latest\nvideo's published date and a list of the most recent videos. The snapshot object contains the following properties: channelId (string): The ID of the monitored YouTube channel. latestVideoPublishedAt (string): The published date of the latest video on the channel (in ISO format). videos (array): An array of video objects representing the most recent videos on the channel, with the same\nproperties as described in the newVideos array.

Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 Core Nodes Branch (If Else) Branch (If Else) The Branch node is a conditional node in your workflow, designed to execute different sets of actions based on a\nspecific condition . This node provides a powerful way to control the flow of your workflow, making it flexible and\ndynamic. Using the Branch node The Branch node evaluates a base condition . If the condition evaluates to \" true \", the node executes the actions\nin the \" Then \" block. If the condition evaluates to \" false \", it proceeds to execute the actions in the \" Else \"\nblock. Supported Comparison Operators To define your conditions, the \"Branch\" node supports the following comparison operators: == : Checks whether two values are equal != : Checks whether two values are not equal. > : Checks whether the first value is greater than the second value. < : Checks whether the first value is less than the second value. >= : Checks whether the first value is greater than or equal to the second value. <= : Checks whether the first value is less than or equal to the second value. \ud83d\udca1 These comparison operators also work on strings . You can use them to compare string values and make decisions\nbased on string conditions. With these operators, you can construct various conditions to control the flow of your workflow based on specific data\nor inputs. Example: Conditional Response Based on Request Body In this example, we'll create a workflow that receives an HTTP request with a JSON body. The workflow will check the\nvalue of the number key in the request body. If the value is greater than 10, the workflow will return a message\nsaying that the number is greater than 10. If the value is less than or equal to 10, the workflow will return a message\nsaying that the number is less than or equal to 10. HTTP Trigger Node Create a workflow with an HTTP Request Trigger to receive incoming requests. Add Branch Node Add a Branch (If Else) node to the workflow. Set Branch Condition Click on the Expression Menu , select Expression Editor . Set the Branch node's condition as: ctx[ \"request\" ][ \"body\" ][ \"number\" ] > 10 Setting Then and Else conditions In the \" Then \" block of the Branch node, add a Return node with the message: ctx[ \"request\" ][ \"body\" ][ \"number\" ] + \" is greater than 10\" . In the \" Else \" block of the Branch node, add another Return node with the message: ctx[ \"request\" ][ \"body\" ][ \"number\" ] + \" is less than 10\" . Test the Workflow Click deploy and send a request to the given endpoint with a JSON body containing the number key. Here's an example body JSON: { \"number\" : 15 } Execution of the Example If the incoming requests' number key has a value greater than 10 (e.g., \"number\": 15 ), the workflow returns 15 is greater than 10 . If the incoming requests' number key has a value less than or equal to 10 (e.g., \"number\": 5 ), the workflow\nreturns 5 is less than or equal to 10 . Nested Branch (Nested If Else) A Nested Branch or a Nested If Else is a conditional structure within another conditional structure. Using\nnested branches allows you to create more complex conditional logic in your workflow by combining multiple levels of\n\"if-else\" statements. This approach is useful when you need to evaluate multiple conditions sequentially, with each\ncondition leading to a different set of actions. Nested Branch Example Let's consider a scenario where we want to categorize incoming numbers into three groups: \"Greater than 20,\" \"Between 10\nand 20,\" and \"Less than or equal to 10.\" HTTP Trigger Node Create a workflow with an HTTP Request Trigger to receive incoming requests. Add Branch Node Add a Branch (If Else) node to the workflow. Set Branch Condition Click on the Expression Menu , select Expression Editor . Set the Branch node's condition as: ctx[ \"request\" ][ \"body\" ][ \"number\" ] < 20 Adding Nested conditions In the \" Then \" block of the first Branch node, add another Branch (If Else) node. Set the condition in the second Branch node as ctx[ \"request\" ][ \"body\" ][ \"number\" ] > 10 In the \" Then \" block of the second Branch node, add a Return node with the expression: ctx[ \"request\" ][ \"body\" ][ \"number\" ] + \" is between 10 and 20\" In the \" Else \" block of the second Branch node, add another Return node with the message: ctx[ \"request\" ][ \"body\" ][ \"number\" ] + \" is less than or equal to 10\" In the \" Else \" block of the first Branch node (i.e., if the number is not greater than 20), add a Return node with the message: ctx[ \"request\" ][ \"body\" ][ \"number\" ] + \" is greater than 20\" Test the Workflow Click deploy and send a request to the given endpoint with a JSON body containing the number key.

Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 Core Nodes Loop Loop The Loop node is a versatile tool in BuildShip that empowers you to iterate over elements within a JSON object, an\narray, or even a literal value. This node serves as a powerful mechanism for processing and manipulating data\niteratively . It is particularly useful when you want to perform a series of actions on each element of the input\nprovided. Looping Functionality The primary functionality of the Loop node is to traverse through all the elements present in the input data and\nperform specified actions on each element. It facilitates the execution of a set of nodes within the loop , allowing\nyou to interact with and modify the data at each iteration. The loop processes each element sequentially. This mode is beneficial when the execution order matters, and actions must\nbe taken step by step. For instance, performing data transformation on each element one after the other. Using the Loop Node The Loop node's functionality revolves around iterating over the elements of the input data and executing a set of\nactions for each element. Here's how you can use the Loop node: Input Configuration : The Loop node accepts three types of input: JSON objects , arrays , or literals .\nYou can provide the input directly in the editor. Concurrency : The Loop node offers the flexibility to set the number of concurrent executions to run. This allows\nyou to control how many iterations are processed simultaneously, enhancing the efficiency of your workflow. (Note: To\nmodify this option, please check the pricing page (opens in a new tab) to see the maximum concurrency\nlimit for your plan.) Node Actions : The Loop node encapsulates a series of nodes within it. This allows you to define the actions\nyou want to perform on each element. You can add nodes for logging, making API calls, calculations, or any other\ndesired functionality. \ud83d\udca1 Example: Data Transformation Imagine you have an array of raw data that needs to undergo multiple processing steps. You can utilize the Loop node in series mode to accomplish this: Input : JSON array containing raw data Loop Body : Within the loop, include nodes that perform data transformation, filtering, and enrichment. By using the Loop node in series mode, you ensure that each data point is processed methodically, producing the desired results.

Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 Core Nodes Switch Switch Node Control the flow of your BuildShip workflow based on switch statements with the Switch Node. The switch node\nevaluates an expression and then executes the corresponding flow that matches the expression\u2019s result. Switch Node Anatomy The Switch node consists of the following components: Expression The Expression input is the main expression whose value is to be evaluated for the Switch Case. Example Input: Query.type // to use switch case on the type parameter in the query Cases The switch node will evaluate the value of the specified expression and execute the corresponding case that matches the\nexpression's result. Example Input: \"image\" // this will check if Query.type === \"image\" \ud83d\udca1 The expression and the case fields of the switch node can be any of the following types: - string - number - boolean Next Case Toggle The Next Case Toggle exists on every switch flow. When toggled to true , it will continue to execute its subsequent\ncase . We can think of this Next Case Toggle like a switch case without a break statement. If a return statement is added inside a case, the Next Case Toggle will be ignored. Default Case If there\u2019s no match specified in the \" Case \" inputs, control is transferred to the flow under the \" Default \" case. Example Implementation Let us understand how to use the Switch Node with an example. Use Case We need a workflow that generates assets for an end user. Given the prompt and type of an asset for generation,\nwe need to implement the switch node to process different flows depending on the type of the asset specified by the\nuser. Request Structure This example workflow will be a REST API type workflow using the REST API Call Trigger as the\nstarting point for our workflow. The REST API Call Trigger will process the incoming request. Let\u2019s say the incoming\nHTTP Request is a GET Request and looks like this: Having two query key value pairs: type specifying the type of asset to generate, and prompt the prompt to be passed\nfor the asset generation. Expression If we need to apply the switch node for a query parameter with the key type in the incoming HTTP Request, then we need\nto add Query.type . Cases We need to apply different flows for the different values of the type query parameter, which let\u2019s say defines the type\nof asset a user wishes to generate. For our example, we assume the user can pass in any of these values: Image Video Animation Audio So the value of the type query parameter can be: \"image\" , \"video\" , \"animation\" , \"audio\" . We can add these four\nvalues as our cases. After defining the cases, we get 5 different branches for each of the specified types and one for the \u201c Default Case \u201d\nwhich is a fallback case - i.e. if there\u2019s no match specified in the \"case\" inputs, control is transferred to the flow\nunder the \"default\" case. For the Default case, we can simply add a return node saying that the type is undefined. Return To return the value let\u2019s add a return node and set its value to Switch to return the generated asset. Our final workflow will look something like this: Need Help? \ud83d\udcac Join BuildShip Community An active and large community of no-code / low-code builders.

Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 Core Nodes Return Return Node The Return Node is used to return values from the workflow . It is the last node in the workflow and is always\nrequired. The Return Node is a crucial component in our workflow logic, designed to handle HTTP response codes and\nreturn a value upon execution. The Return Node is a non-configurable node that takes in predefined HTTP status codes and produces a corresponding\nvalue as output. Supported Status Codes The Return Node supports the following HTTP status codes: 200 : OK 201 : Created 202 : Accepted 204 : No Content 400 : Bad Request 401 : Unauthorized 403 : Forbidden 404 : Not Found 500 : Internal Server Error Return Value The Return Nodes in the workflow allow users to generate specific output values based on various sources, providing\nflexibility and customization to the workflow logic. The Return Node can be used to return a value from the following\nsources: Autofill Values using AI The Return Nodes can leverage the power of AI to autofill values automatically. By using AI-driven autofill feature,\nusers can save time and ensure that the generated values align with the workflow's objectives. Values via Expressions Return Nodes support expressions, allowing users to create dynamic output values by combining variables, constants, and\nfunctions. Expressions enable users to manipulate data and perform calculations, making it possible to generate\nresponses that adapt to changing conditions during workflow execution. Request Components In workflows involving REST API triggers , Return Nodes can return values derived from different components of the\nrequest. Users can extract data from the request's headers, parameters, and body to generate meaningful responses. For Example: The Return Node can extract the user's name from the request header and use it to personalize the\noutput message. Returning Output Values from Previous Nodes The power of workflows lies in their ability to connect and pass data between nodes. Return Nodes can utilize output\nvalues from previous nodes in the workflow. By referencing the outputs of other nodes, users can build complex logic and\ncreate cascading effects. For Example: If a previous node performs a calculation or retrieves data from a database, the Return Node can use\nthat data to provide the final result of the workflow.

Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 Core Nodes Empty Script Script Node A Script Node is a flexible building block in your workflow automation system. It provides a blank canvas for you to\nwrite your custom logic. Users can configure input parameters , specify the output format , and add metadata to describe the node's\npurpose and appearance. Customizing the Script Node Node Logic The core of a Script Node is its logic, where you define the custom behavior of the node. This logic is typically\nwritten in JavaScript/TypeScript. Below is an example of a Script Logic for generating QR codes: import { toDataURL } from 'qrcode' ; export default async function generateQRCode ({ url }) { const qrCodeDataURL = await toDataURL (url); return qrCodeDataURL; } In the above example, we import the toDataURL function from the qrcode NPM Library (opens in a new tab) and create an asynchronous function generateQRCode . It\ntakes an input parameter url , generates a QR code image, and returns its data URL. Input Parameters Input parameters are values that users can configure when using the Node. These parameters can be set in the form UI or\nvia JSON schema. Here's the input configuration (in JSON) for the QR code generation node: { \"type\" : \"object\" , \"properties\" : { \"url\" : { \"buildship\" : { \"index\" : 0 } , \"description\" : \"The URL to generate a QR code for\" , \"title\" : \"URL\" , \"type\" : \"string\" } } , \"required\" : [ \"url\" ] } Here, type : Specifies that the input is an object. properties : Defines the available input properties. In this case, we have a single property, \"url.\" url : Describes the \"url\" property. It has a title, description, and data type (string). The \"buildship\" section\nincludes an index, which determines the order in which this input is displayed to users. The \"required\" field\nindicates that the \"url\" parameter is mandatory. Output Format You can specify the output format of the node to inform users about what to expect from this node. For the QR code generation node, the output format is as follows: { \"buildship\" : {} , \"title\" : \"Base64 Data URL\" , \"description\" : \"base64 data URL of the generated QR code image\" , \"type\" : \"string\" , \"properties\" : {} } Here, description : Provides a brief description of the output, which is the base64 data URL of the generated QR code\nimage. type : Indicates that the output is of type \"string.\" Node Metadata Node metadata allows you to provide information about the node's appearance and purpose. Here's an example of metadata for the QR code generation node: { \"icon\" : { \"svg\" : \"<path d=\\\"M15 21h-2v-2h2v2zm-2-7h-2v5h2v-5zm8-2h-2v4h2v-4zm-2-2h-2v2h2v-2zM7 12H5v2h2v-2zm-2-2H3v2h2v-2zm7-5h2V3h-2v2zm-7.5-.5v3h3v-3h-3zM8 9H4c-.55 0-1-.45-1-1V4c0-.55.45-1 1-1h4c.55 0 1 .45 1 1v4c0 .55-.45 1-1 1zm-3.5 7.5v3h3v-3h-3zM8 21H4c-.55 0-1-.45-1-1v-4c0-.55.45-1 1-1h4c.55 0 1 .45 1 1v4c0 .55-.45 1-1 1zm8.5-16.5v3h3v-3h-3zM20 9h-4c-.55 0-1-.45-1-1V4c0-.55.45-1 1-1h4c.55 0 1 .45 1 1v4c0 .55-.45 1-1 1zm-1 10v-3h-4v2h2v3h4v-2h-2zm-2-7h-4v2h4v-2zm-4-2H7v2h2v2h2v-2h2v-2zm1-1V7h-2V5h-2v4h4zM6.75 5.25h-1.5v1.5h1.5v-1.5zm0 12h-1.5v1.5h1.5v-1.5zm12-12h-1.5v1.5h1.5v-1.5z\\\"></path>\" , \"type\" : \"SVG\" } , \"name\" : \"Generate QR Code\" , \"description\" : \"Generates a QR code for the given URL and returns the QR code's URL\" , \"id\" : \"generate-qr-code\" } Here, icon : The node's icon, represented as an SVG path.

Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 Generate with AI AI Generated Nodes There are two ways to build custom nodes in BuildShip: Picking pre-built nodes via the Nodeverse Building custom nodes via AI Building Custom Node via AI In BuildShip, you have the flexibility to create custom nodes for your specific use cases using an integrated AI-powered\nnode building feature. This process allows you to streamline the node creation process through intelligent prompts.\nLet's explore how to build custom nodes using this AI feature: Open the AI Node Generator Click on the wand icon \ud83e\ude84 on the top left menu bar to open the AI Node Generator. This action will open the AI Node\nGenerator, where you'll be able to initiate the node creation process. Give the prompt to generate the node The AI Node Generator modal asks you to give a prompt for the node you want to generate. This prompt serves as a\nguideline for the AI to understand your requirements. Check out the following image for an example prompt. Once you have given the prompt, click on the \" Generate \" button\nto generate the node. \ud83d\udca1 Users can also specify the exact format they want the output of the node to be generated in. For example, if you want the output to be in the form of a JSON object, you can specify that in the prompt. The resultant output should be in the form of a JSON object with the following format: { \"cover\" : { \"title\" : string , \"subtitle\" : string , \"illustration\" : string } , \"pages\" : [ { \"index\" : number , \"illustration\" : string , \"text\" : string } ] } Example Prompt to Generate Node using any API With this example prompt you can generate a perfect node for any API or SDK module. For this example, we will generate a\nnode for the Adalo API. Typically the best way to generate a node with AI is using a prompt like this.. 1. input, 2. output, and 3. docs API\ncode (which can be found in the official documentation - https://help.adalo.com/integrations/the-adalo-api/push-notifications#curl (opens in a new tab) .) You can customize the steps according to\nyour usecase. \ud83d\udca1 Make sure to always import any npm package using Named\nimport (opens in a new tab) declaration.\nExample: import module from \"module-name\"; & import Crypto from 'crypto'; Explore and Modify the Node via the Node Explorer Once the AI generates the node based on your prompt, you can explore its functionalities and make further modifications\nusing \" Node Explorer </> \". This is a powerful tool that allows you to fine-tune the node's logic , input\nparameters , output configurations , and metadata descriptions . For more details on customizing nodes, refer to the editing nodes section . Testing the Node The Node Editor provides a convenient testing feature, allowing you to test the newly created node using sample data\nwithout deploying the entire workflow. This ensures that the node operates as expected before full implementation. To\nlearn more about testing nodes, refer to the testing nodes section . By following these steps, you can efficiently create custom nodes tailored to your specific automation requirements! \ud83d\ude80 AI Autofill Input BuildShip offers an AI Autofill feature that allows users to automatically populate node inputs with static or dynamic\ndata. Here's how you can effectively leverage AI Autofill to automate the node data: Open the Expression Editor (x) While configuring a node, locate the expression icon (x) and click on it to open the Expression Editor. Select and Define a Prompt Within the expression editor, you'll notice an Autofill icon . Click on this icon to enable the add your prompt. Provide a precise and descriptive prompt that articulates the specific data you need. The clarity of this prompt is\ncrucial for the AI to generate accurate values. For instance, you might define a prompt like: I need to autofill the value to the current unix timestamp All you need to do now is to check if the generated value matches your requirements. You can modify the prompt as many\ntimes as you like and request a different value to fit your use case.

It\nsupports various HTTP methods, content types, and authentication options. You can provide query parameters, request\nbody, and choose whether to await the response or not. Node Inputs The API Call node accepts the following inputs: HTTP Method The HTTP method to use for the API call. Supported values are: GET POST PUT DELETE PATCH URL The URL endpoint of the API to be called, for example: https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather . Authorization The authorization header for the API call, if required (e.g., Bearer or Basic token), for example: Bearer abc123 . This authorization header will be added to the request headers while sending the API call. Query Parameters The query parameters for the API call. They will be merged with the URL if any are provided. For example: If the URL is https://api.example.com/data and the query parameters are {\"query1\": \"value1\", \"query2\": \"value2\"} , the final URL will be https://api.example.com/data?query1=value1&query2=value2 . Sample Input: { \"query1\" : \"value1\" , \"query2\" : \"value2\" } Body The body of the request. It can be a JSON object or a string. The content type of the body can be specified using the Content Type field. If the content type is application/json , the body will be sent as a JSON object. Sample Input: { \"key\" : \"value\" , \"data\" : { \"nested\" : \"value\" } } Content Type The content type of the API call. Available options are: application/json (default) application/x-www-form-urlencoded multipart/form-data text/plain Await? A boolean value indicating whether the workflow should wait for the API response before proceeding to the next node. If\nset to false , the node will return immediately with null data. Node Outputs The API Call node returns an object with the following properties: status : The HTTP status code of the API response. data : The response data from the API. If the response is JSON, it will be parsed into an object. Otherwise, it will\nbe returned as a string. Testing the API Call Node Navigate to the 'API Call' node and fill in the fields with the required information. Click on the '\u25b6\ufe0e' Test Button located in the top-right corner of the Node. This will open up the Node testing panel where you can enter the test\ninputs to execute the Node. Enter the values for the required fields like HTTP Method , URL , Content Type , Query Parameters , Body , and Authorization . Click on the 'Run Test' button to execute the Node. If the execution is successful , a green check-mark \u2705 will appear on the node. To view the output of the test run,\nclick on the check-mark. You can copy the output by clicking ' Copy Value '. \ud83d\udca1 In case of an unsuccessful execution, an error message will be displayed. For example, an incorrect URL can lead to an\nerror.

Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 Utility Nodes Crawler Crawler \ud83d\udd77\ufe0f Extract data from an entire website by crawling through and scraping all its pages. Using the Crawler Node The Crawler node performs parallel crawling of web pages using headless Chrome with Puppeteer. Imagine you want to\nscrape https://www.buildship.com (or any other website) and all its linked pages. You can use the Crawler node to\nachieve this. The node accepts these parameters: Website URL (required) : The URL of the website to start crawling. Selector (optional) : The HTML selector to grab the inner text from. Max Concurrency (optional) : Number of crawls to run in parallel (max limit: 20). Max Requests Per Crawl (optional) : Max requests to be executed per crawl (max limit: 50). Useful to limit the\nnumber of pages to crawl. Proxy URLs (optional) : List of proxy urls to be used automatically by crawler for all connections. Crawl ID (optional) : Use crawlId returned from previous crawling to continue crawling remaining urls. This is\nuseful when you want to continue crawling from where you left off. Usage Example: Suppose you want to scrape all the pages of https://www.buildship.com : To begin we can setup the crawler node, set the URL to https://www.buildship.com and the selector to body . Let's\nalso set the maxConcurrency to 5 and maxRequestsPerCrawl to 10 . So after execution, the Crawler node output will look something like below: { // Total pages crawled \"count\" : 14 , \"desc\" : false , // Crawled pages \"items\" : [ { \"url\" : \"https://buildship.com/\" , // URL of the page \"title\" : \"BuildShip | Visual Low-code Backend Builder\" , // Title of the page \"description\" : \"\" , \"contents\" : \"AI Assistant Builder is here - Create Chatbots on your own data \ud83d\udc49...\" , // Scraped content of the page \"urls\" : [ \"https://buildship.com/assistant-api\" ] // List of URLs found in the page } , ... ] } NOTE: See this link for a complete sample output of the Crawler node used to scrape the Buildship website: Crawler Node Output .

Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 Utility Nodes Scrape Web URL (Dynamic) Scrape Web URL (Dynamic) Extract data from web pages by scraping their text content. This node works great for dynamic and complex sites that\nrely on javascript to load. Using the Scrape Web URL Node (Dynamic) The Scrape Web URL node's functionality includes fetching the content of a web page for the provided url. Under the\nhood, it uses Puppeteer (opens in a new tab) to scrape the web page thus allowing for more dynamic scraping. The node\naccepts these parameters: URL (required) : The URL of the page you want to scrape. Example: https://docs.buildship.com (opens in a new tab) . Selector (optional) : Specific HTML selector you want to extract text content from (by default body will be used). Steps (optional) : List of steps to follow after loading the page in given url. Usage Example: Suppose you want to scrape the below information: To begin we can setup the node, set the URL to https://www.google.com/ and the selector to #result-stats . This will\nextract the text content of the search result stats. The steps parameter can be used to interact with the page before\nextracting the text content. So, the steps input value would look something like below: [ // type \"buildship\" in google search input box { \"action\" : \"type\" , \"params\" : [ \"#APjFqb\" , \"buildship\" ] } , // click on google search button { \"action\" : \"click\" , \"params\" : [ \".gNO89b\" ] } , // wait for searched query to load and if page doesn't load within 3 seconds, move to next step { \"action\" : \"waitForNavigation\" , \"params\" : [ { \"timeout\" : 3000 , \"waitUntil\" : \"load\" } ] } ] And after execution we get the information we're looking for: The root selector value is the selector from which you want to extract the text-content, after all steps are executed. Each step object in steps list consists of action and params . The action parameter is the name of any method from puppeteer-page-methods (opens in a new tab) list. And, the params is list of parameters\nrequired in the selected action (a puppeteer method name). For one of the action - type , the parameters for the puppeteer-type-method (opens in a new tab) are: Hence, the step object for type action would look like: { // puppeteer method name \"action\" : \"type\" , // \"#APjFqb\" is the \"selector\" (the selector to find <input>) // \"buildship\" is the \"text\" (the value to be typed in <input>) // As per parameters list of \"type\" method, the third parameter is optional, // hence we can either include or exclude it from \"params\" list \"params\" : [ \"#APjFqb\" , \"buildship\" ] } Need Help? \ud83d\udcac Join BuildShip Community An active and large community of no-code / low-code builders.

Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 AI Assistant AI Assistant Builder Guide AI Assistant Builder Guide Since the launch of GPTs, we have seen a lot of custom AI agents help people in their daily life, at specific tasks, at\nwork, or home. Most of these AI agents live in the ChatGPT interface and are only available for paid users within OpenAI. To open the\naccess to these GPTs, at OpenAI Dev Day, the company introduced OpenAI Assistant API (opens in a new tab) which included new capabilities to build\ncustom AI Assistants. Assistant Variants BuildShip offers a variety of AI Assistant nodes with various models and providers. Click on the links below for\ndetailed information on each one: OpenAI Assistant \u2192 OpenAI Streaming Assistant \u2192 Claude Assistant \u2192 Azure Assistant \u2192 Groq Assistant \u2192 Building AI Assistant Using the OpenAI Assistant API especially connected to your apps and database with function calling tools does require\ncoding knowledge and the ability to host, deploy your workflows, etc. With BuildShip's OpenAI Assistant Builder\nIntegration, you can now leverage the powerful capabilities of OpenAI Assistant without writing any code visually. You\ncan also connect but with the ability to low code if you would like to bring all these capabilities to your applications\nhelping you without writing a line of code. In this article we\u2019ll cover the following topics: How to create an AI Assistant Connect your AI Assistant to BuildShip Add Memory to your AI Assistant to chat in conversation style: Example Quiz Tutor Tool usage: Connect database and tools to your AI Assistant - teach your assistants to use tools to do tasks for you\nlike sending emails or updating your database Example and templates \ud83d\ude80 You can follow OpenAI Assistant Guide (opens in a new tab) and build your own\nAssistant. Create an Assistant An Assistant follows custom instructions and can leverage models, tools, and knowledge to respond to user messages. In\nthis example, we are creating an Assistant who's a personal history tutor who engages with people by asking questions. The main parameters to consider are: Name & assistant ID : You can name your assistants. When saving, an assistant ID will be auto-generated and shown\nto you below that. Instructions : How the Assistant should behave and respond. Model : The GPT version you want to use. Tools : Using Code Interpreter for running code or Retrieval to update files. Functions : To define custom behaviors, you'll learn how we'll use our BuildShip nodes as tools for our assistants. Now, let's learn how we can access Assistants outside the context of OpenAI using BuildShip. Connect your Assistant to BuildShip From the Template view, you can search for the Basic Assistant template that will create a basic workflow structure\nfor you. If you already have a workflow, you can also search OpenAI Assistant in the Node Explorer. In both cases, you\nwill have to fill up your OpenAI API Key and the Assistant ID to easily connect it. You can also update your Instructions from here or already use what you defined. \u261d If you leave the Instructions field empty, OpenAI will consider what you have already defined in OpenAI\nplayground. After that, you can test it out via a message like Who was Leonardo da Vinci? . Remember, you can use variables to\neasily change the inputs for your nodes. We assume passing the prompt as a parameter in the POST request: We assume\npassing the prompt as a parameter in the POST request: { \"message\" : \"Who was Leonardo da Vinci?\" } We can now access the Assistant response via the parameter response , which returns its last message (you'll probably\nget a message similar to the following): { \"response\" : \"Leonardo da Vinci was a Renaissance polymath active mainly in Italy from the late 15th to the early 16th century. Quiz Question: Which of the following is NOT a work of Leonardo da Vinci? A) Vitruvian Man B) The School of Athens C) Lady with an Ermine D) Ginevra de' Benci\" , \"threadId\" : \"thread_KHdD6NGPwx0yY6mIkj0UgMPe\" } Notice how each time you run your workflow, a new conversation will be started, and you'll get an answer from your\nAssistant. Let's now explore the output from the OpenAI assistant node. We can also access the following parameters: Messages : A list of all the messages from the conversation ThreadId : Unique ID of the current conversation In the following section, you\u2019ll learn how to use Thread ID to save and continue conversations. Memory & conversation When you start chatting with an Assistant, a Thread is created representing this conversation. We recommend saving\nthem as soon as the conversation is initiated. You can use BuildShip's internal database to do that. We provide two\nbasic templates for Saving a Thread ID and accessing our history of threads. For now, let's just copy the thread ID. Let's assume that we copy the thread ID from the first message and include it in\nour request. Our new message is the answer to the past quiz and the previous threadId . { \"message\" : \"The School Of Athens\" , \"threadId\" : \"your_thread_id\" } And it works! We can see from the Assistant's response that we correctly answered, and the conversation continues. { \"response\" : \"Correct! *The School of Athens* is not a work by Leonardo da Vinci. It was actually painted by Raphael, another master of the Renaissance.\" , \"threadId\" : \"thread_KHdD6NGPwx0yY6mIkj0UgMPe\" } Saving Chat History Externally in a Database To store the chat history via the AI Assistant nodes to any database your could follow the following approach: Your OpenAI Assistant node already uses a threadId for maintaining the chat history, which is also being returned\nfrom the Assistant node for reference. This can be used as the Document ID in the collection for storing the chat\nhistory externally. The OpenAI Assistant also returns an output called messages which is an array of the entire chat history associated with the threadId . This is the data we need to store to our database (or, process as required and then\nstore depending upon your usecase). For instance, we need to store the chat history to our BuildShip Database . All we need to do\nis simply add a \" Create Document \" node from the BuildShip Database Integration. Give it a Collection Name . The Document ID needs to be the threadId as returned from the AI Assistant node. Pass in the messages output from\nthe OpenAI Assistant node as the Data to be added/updated, as: { \"fieldName\" : Messages } Make sure to set the Merge field for the Create Document node as false . This would entirely update the messages\nfield every time, as the items get added to the chat history. Examples Use case (I): Chat with Assistant Now it's your turn, you can download the template Chat with Assistant (opens in a new tab) as an example to start. You can modify the\nInstructions and your messages and see how the Assistant behaves. INSTRUCTIONS : You are a personal history tutor. You will answer questions in a concise way. If no question is given, you should provide a historical fact. You must also engage with users by creating little quizzes with 4 possible options to answer each question You can test it directly from the BuildShip Test button, or you can deploy it and call your endpoint from your preferred\nenvironment. Remember that if you want to maintain the conversation, you should pass the threadId together with the message in your\nPOST request: { \"message\" : \"your_new_message\" , \"threadId\" : \"your_thread_id\" } In the next tutorial, we are going to show you how to use different tools with your assistant. Use Case (II): Document Retrieval from OpenAI OpenAI offers two hosted tools (opens in a new tab) that you can use in your workflows: Code Interpreter and Knowledge Retrieval . In this example, we will focus on using the knowledge retrieval\ncapabilities that allow you to make OpenAI assistants answer based on provided data. Before that, let's add some context about how large language models like GPTs respond. As you may know, these models are\ntrained with a large portion of the internet , so their responses are based on that information. Here, an important\naspect to consider is that each dataset uses available information up to a certain date (e.g., Up to December 2023).\nThen we can assume that OpenAI models (opens in a new tab) will not only\nanswer based on: Public data: You need to verify the specific point in time that this model was trained and which information was\nused to do it. Offline and private information: In general, you are responsible for providing context to the model when referring\nto non-online or private data. Additionally, you should consider that it's a generative model, which means that it produces content based on the\ngiven data rather than searching through information. This implies that you cannot fully trust the responses, and it's\nbetter to fact-check important information. To overcome this limitation, OpenAI offers the knowledge retrieval (opens in a new tab) tool to upload files as\ncontext for the assistant. There are some limitations (e.g., 512 MB and around 2M tokens), so make sure you check it\nwhen you prepare your assistants. In our BuildShip integration, we can also use this functionality from OpenAI. We must upload the files and then make\nsure to enable File Search . In this example, we are going to use Augmenting Human Intellect (opens in a new tab) from Douglas Engelbart as a reference material. This book from the early 1960s has had a profound impact on fields such\nas computer science, artificial intelligence, and human-computer interaction. Let's see how we can create an Assistant that responds to us and provides references to this pioneer's work. You can\nalso, download the template Assistant with Retrieval (opens in a new tab) as a\nstarting point. Step 1: Set up your Assistant Go to your Assistant Playground (opens in a new tab) and create a new Assistant with the following\ndetails: Instructions : You are an expert on Douglas Engelbart. You have access to his original papers and books, and you can answer questions in a comprehensive, casual, and easy-to-read manner. You give detailed insights and explanations with a friendly and approachable tone. You are here to make learning about this computing legend as engaging and accessible as possible. You must always provide references from the materials you have access to. Model : gpt-4-turbo-preview Make sure to enable File Search File upload : get the file you want to use as a reference If you test it out, you are going to see that now the Assistant not only provides the responses but also references\n(e.g., citing format [1]) from where it got the information! Step 2. Connect to BuildShip Within BuildShip, you should also enable Built-In Tools \u2192 Document Retrieval to make sure it will use the files you\nuploaded from OpenAI. Let\u2019s try it out with a simple question: { \"message\" : \"Which is the key point of the Engelbart thesis? Be concise in one sentence\" } You will get a response similar to the one below. As you can see, we can now access the file annotations which provides\nus with the exact quote from the reference we uploaded. As an overview, you must consider text : the cite ID you have in the response text start_index & end_index : where in the response text is this annotation placed quote : the exact text used to answer the question file_id : from which file we extracted the quote. E.g: file-OSX4KiqFNgygxfS1NHOyeRIY corresponds to our Engelbart\nwork reference { \"response\" : \"The key point of Engelbart's thesis is the development of methods to augment the human intellect, incorporating various means, including technology, with a system-oriented approach to boost intellectual effectiveness, aiming for both immediate practical benefits and long-term significant outcomes\u30101\u2020source\u3011.\" , \"annotations\" : [ { \"type\" : \"file_citation\" , \"text\" : \"\u30101\u2020source\u3011\" , \"start_index\" : 297 , \"end_index\" : 307 , \"file_citation\" : { \"file_id\" : \"file-OSX4KiqFNgygxfS1NHOyeRIY\" , \"quote\" : \"This report covers the first phase of a program aimed at developing means to augment the\\nhuman intellect. These \\\"means\\\" can include many things--all of which appear to be but\\nextensions of means developed andused in the past to help man apply his native sensory \\nmental and motor capabilities--and we consider the whole system of a human and his\\naugmentation means as a proper field of search for practical possibilities. It is a very\\nimportant system to our society and like most systems its performance can best be improved\\nby considering the whole as a set of interacting components rather than by considering the\\ncomponents in isolation. \\n\\n\\nThis kind of system approach to human intellectual effectiveness does not find a ready-made\\nconceptual framework such as exists for established disciplines. Before a research program\\ncan be designed to pursue such an approach intelligently so that practical benefits might be\\nderived within a reasonable time while also producing results of longrange significance\" } } ] , \"threadId\" : \"thread_5GU5KsyoIlHHtPCgyxGsIbDm\" } Now you can use these annotations to provide references from the responses generated by your assistants. Remember to\nenable knowledge retrieval if you upload files to OpenAI if you want your assistants to use them. You can also use other techniques to make your assistants use your own data apart from OpenAI internal knowledge\nretrieval. We can also define custom functions for our assistants. In the following examples, we\u2019ll explore different ways to make our agents respond accurately based on our data and use\ndifferent tools to fulfill our request. Use case (III): Website Q&A Till now we have learned how to access and follow up conversations with Assistants within BuildShip, and how to use\ninternal OpenAI functions. Now let\u2019s explore how we can teach these AI agents to use tools to perform the required tasks. This can include\nconnecting to different services and products such as Gmail, Discord messaging, Notion API or Supabase amongst\nothers. Using BuildShip we can simply provide extra capabilities to these agents by adding nodes to the assistant and modifying\nthe original instructions to support that. This tutorial corresponds to the template Website Q&A (opens in a new tab) Step 1. Decide which nodes to use Let\u2019s start with a simple example, using web scraping for retrieving updated information. We can search for Scrape Web\nURL node and add it within BuildShip. Here it\u2019s important to properly describe what this node does. In our example, we\u2019ll update both the name and the\ndescription of the node: New Name \u2192 get website New Description \u2192 Scrape a given web url and return the text content Then, we need to update also the instructions to set up some guidelines regarding when to use this new tool. Internally,\nwe are describing our nodes as functions (opens in a new tab) which the\nAssistant will intelligently decide to use. We are not adding any extra prompts to the user requests, so everything you\ndescribe is what the assistant is gonna use to decide. Instructions : You are an expert in searching for information from different sources. Your goal is to respond to the users' questions and requests using the source they provide. You must respond in a concise way and readable way. When you are given tools to use, you must use them following the guidelines for each tool. Guidelines: - when a user asks for information about a specific website you must use 'get website' to scrape a given website and return the information Step 2. Decide which inputs will be auto-filled Assistant can intelligently fill up the inputs from your tools. To do that, you must consider which context and\naccessible information is available for it. You are responsible for filling in inputs related to information you are not sending to OpenAI. For example your secret\nKeys or labels from your internal database. In addition, we also recommend filling the inputs we know they are not gonna\nchange. In our example, we can consider that the URL provided by the user will change in each conversation. For that reason, we\ncan set up that the URL is auto-filled by the AI. Step 3. Test it out Finally, let\u2019s try it out. We can ask the assistant to use a website on plans in a city like Timeout (opens in a new tab) to answer user specific\nquestions: { \"message\" : \"What plans I can do in Barcelona? Use this website to answer: https://www.timeout.com/barcelona/things-to-do/best-things-to-do-in-barcelona\" } You can make sure that your assistant used the provided nodes by checking the Green status in the node. In this case it\nwill scrape the provided website and return it to the Assistant You can expand this example by providing more example URLs or scrapping out entire websites to provide your assistant a\nricher knowledge base. In the following example, we are gonna see how to provide a different knowledge base to talk with the assistant: Chat\nwith your Spreadsheets Use case (IV): Chat with your GSheets In this example, we are gonna learn how you can give access to a Google spreadsheet to your assistant using the Get\nSheets node. You can also clone the template Chat with your GSheets (opens in a new tab) to your project directly. In this tutorial, let\u2019s imagine we have an online shop of sustainable furniture called Azura Home. We have our\ncollection of products in a spreadsheet. We have created a public dataset for you to access, called Azura Home Collection (opens in a new tab) .\nIt contains data emulating different products for this shop: We can directly use this spreadsheet by pasting the shared link within the Node parameters Then you should update your instructions to make sure it uses this newly provided node: Instructions : You are an Azura Home specialist. You have a detailed knowledge of Azura Home's eco-friendly Mediterranean furniture and decor products through a comprehensive dataset in a spreadsheet. Your task is to provide informative and helpful responses to user inquiries about product materials, design inspirations, sustainability practices, styles or pricing and any other specifics they might be interested in. If needed, you should ask extra questions on style preferences, available space, etc. Your answers should reflect the brand's commitment to sustainability, craftsmanship, and the Mediterranean aesthetic, helping users make informed decisions while fostering an appreciation for the unique qualities of each piece in the Azura Home collection. When you are given tools to use, you must use them following the guidelines for each tool. Guidelines: - when you start the conversation, you must use 'get sheets' to access Azure Home collection of products in Google Spreadsheets You can also update the description of the tool as described below: access Azure Home collection of products in Google Spreadsheets After that, you can directly test it and see how it responds using your spreadsheet data. Prompt : { \"message\" : \"Give me 3 sofa recommendations for less than 1k\" } Response: Based on your preference for sofas under $1,000, here are three excellent recommendations from Azura Home's eco-friendly Mediterranean collection: 1. **Valletta Velvet Sofa** - **Material** : Velvet - **Description** : Luxurious velvet sofa with plush cushions, perfect for a cozy living room. Its glam style brings an elegant and warm atmosphere that's both inviting and stylish. - **Price** : $750 2. **Vis Loveseat** - **Material** : Suede - **Description** : Compact yet comfortable loveseat, perfect for small spaces or as an addition to your living room. With its modern design, this loveseat can blend seamlessly into various interior designs, offering versatility and charm. - **Price** : $700 3. **Pag Chaise Lounge** - **Material** : Leather - **Description** : Elegant leather chaise lounge, offering a luxurious spot for relaxation. This contemporary piece adds a touch of sophistication to any space, perfect for those moments of leisure and reading. - **Price** : $950 Each of these options has been selected for its quality materials, eco-friendly focus, and beautiful Mediterranean-inspired design aesthetics. Whether you're looking for the plush comfort of velvet, the sleek look of suede, or the elegance of leather, these sofas offer a great way to enhance your living space while staying within your budget. We can continue the conversation and ask for a complement for a selected sofa: { \"message\" : \"I like the Valetta one, which small table combines with it\" , \"threadId\" : \"your_thread_id\" } Response: For a sofa as luxurious and inviting as the **Valletta Velvet Sofa** , you'd want a small table that complements its glam aesthetic while also offering functionality and a touch of Mediterranean charm. Considering the design elements and materials of the Valletta Velvet Sofa, I recommend the **Mykonos End Table** to pair with it. The blend of glass material with the plush velvet of the sofa introduces a textural contrast that's both visually appealing and functional, offering a sleek surface for drinks, books, or decorative items. The elegance and simplicity of the Mykonos End Table echo the Mediterranean aesthetic Azura Home is known for, making it a perfect companion to the Valletta Velvet Sofa in creating a cozy, stylish living space. This pairing reflects the Azura Home's commitment to sustainability, craftsmanship, and the Mediterranean aesthetic, ensuring that your living room not only looks beautiful but also resonates with the values of eco-friendly and ethical design. If you have further questions or need more recommendations, feel free to ask! With this simple example, you see how to take advantage of assistants' capabilities to access tools to chat with your\ndata. You can adapt it to your preferred knowledge source like Airtable or Notion amongst others. Use case (V): Data analyst assistant In this tutorial, we are gonna show how our assistants can access data from a spreadsheet and help us analyze this data.\nYou can also explore the template Data Analyst (opens in a new tab) to see how it's built. We have generated possible responses from a discovery survey (opens in a new tab) for a\nfictional app called AI Tutor. The goal of this survey is to capture potential users' challenges when learning or\nteaching and their perception of how technology could help them. Let\u2019s say that now we want to process this data to better understand potential customers and capture their possible\nexpectations and needs to guide our product roadmap. Firstly, we need to add a tool to access the spreadsheet to the assistant. You can update the node description to better\ndescribe what this spreadsheet contains: to access user survey data from Google spreadsheets Then you can also update the instructions to guide the assistant to use the Get sheets node to answer the questions: Instructions : You are a Data Insight Analyst. You should be concise and accurate and provide accurate analysis, ensuring that its interpretations and groupings are well-supported by the data. You have a formal, professional tone, focusing on providing concise, evidence-based responses. When additional information is needed for a comprehensive analysis, you will request more data rather than making assumptions. You should avoid speculation and you should provide precise, relevant analytical insights, tailored to enhance the user's understanding of the data When you are given tools to use, you must use them following the guidelines for each tool. Guidelines: - when you start, you must use 'Get Sheets' to access user survey data from Google Spreadsheets ` You are a Data Insight Analyst. You should be concise and accurate and provide accurate analysis, ensuring that its\ninterpretations and groupings are well-supported by the data. You have a formal, professional tone, focusing on\nproviding concise, evidence-based responses. When additional information is needed for a comprehensive analysis, you\nwill request more data rather than making assumptions. You should avoid speculation and you should provide precise,\nrelevant analytical insights, tailored to enhance the user's understanding of the data When you are given tools to use, you must use them following the guidelines for each tool. Guidelines: when you start, you must use 'Get Sheets' to access user survey data from Google spreadsheets `` After that, you can already test it out: { \"message\" : \"How many users are teachers?\" } Response Based on the provided data, there are **4 users** who have identified their role as _Teacher_ . These users are: 1. Liam Roberts - Teaches high school math 2. Noah Harris - High school science teacher 3. Olivia Sanchez - Elementary school teacher 4. Natalie Wilson - Middle school art teacher Once you already asked a question, you can experiment with different ones. You\u2019ll see that the responses will be faster\nsince the assistant accesses the spreadsheet in the beginning and later uses it during the conversation: { \"message\" : \"Which are the most common challenges when learning?\" , \"threadId\" : \"thread_Ey5hYxgvbXK674uaCCjOq2ux\" } Response The common challenges in the current learning environments, as identified by the users in the provided data, are: 1. **Lack of Personalized Attention:** Several users expressed concerns about the inability to receive personalized attention in their learning environments. This issue was mentioned in various contexts, including engaging students in remote learning, keeping up with the pace of the class, and catering to learning differences. 2. **Difficulty Understanding Certain Subjects:** Difficulty in understanding complex or specific subjects was another recurring theme. Users from different educational backgrounds, including engineering, biology, and language learning, reported this challenge. 3. **Motivation to Study:** Motivation, or rather the lack thereof, was pinpointed as a struggle both for learners trying to keep up with their coursework and for teachers trying to keep students engaged. We can follow up the conversation and ask for more specific data and quotes from users { \"message\" : \"give me this data of difficulty on understanding concepts in % and with quotes of users\" , \"threadId\" : \"thread_Ey5hYxgvbXK674uaCCjOq2ux\" } Response Based on the user descriptions provided in the dataset, the common challenges in learning environments are quantified and supported by quotes as follows: 2. **Difficulty Understanding Certain Subjects** - (4 out of 15 quotes) **27%** - Ethan Ward: _...understand complex engineering concepts._ - Eva Jackson: _...difficulty understanding certain subjects._ - Mia Clark: _...improve language skills_ Note that some quotes were interpreted in context to fit the identified categories, and multiple challenges might be represented by a single quote due to the multifaceted nature of these issues. By providing this access to our spreadsheets now we can explore together with our assistant the data and speed up our\nanalysis. You can experiment with other data sources and do different types of data analysis using your assistant. Use case (VI): Chat with your database In this example, we'll learn how you can ask the Assistant to use your own data to answer your questions. Until now, we\nassumed that assistants would use their training data to answer our requests. However, we can also make them use our\ninternal data sources. Let's illustrate this with a use case involving internal databases. Let\u2019s imagine we have an Italian restaurant and we\nwant our customers to get recommendations based on our menu. This tutorial corresponds to Chat with your Database (opens in a new tab) from our\ntemplates. Step 1. Prepare your data In our case, let\u2019s assume this menu is in our own database with full descriptions, prices and options for each dish. A prerequisite for this tutorial is to create a collection within BuildShip named MyMenu. You can use your preferred format for your data just make sure that you are giving the Assistant a node or workflow to access it You can use our sample dataset in a JSON format and import it to your project to test this workflow. Here, we propose\ntwo sample datasets including starters, main dishes, desserts and beverages: Small : 16 elements (opens in a new tab) Large : 42 elements (opens in a new tab) Step 2. Update instructions and node descriptions In this case, we are gonna tell the Assistant to access our BuildShip Collection via the Collection Query node . Once added, we update the node name and description to match this new scenario. \u2728 New Name \u2192 access menu\nNew Description \u2192 get the list of dishes from the restaurant menu Then, we also update instructions to include this tool usage: INSTRUCTIONS : You are an expert waitress at an Italian fine-dining restaurant. You are familiar with all of the dishes on the menu and are able to recommend the best dishes to customers based on their preferences. When you are given tools to use, you must use them following the guidelines for each tool. Guidelines: - When the user asks for a menu recommendation you must use the 'access menu' to get the list of dishes from the restaurant menu Step 3 Test it out You can test your new Menu Assistant and get recommendations based on your database. As an example below you can check\nhow the Assistant gives a nice recommendation Prompt : We want a vegetarian menu for two, we are gonna share two starters and a main dish. Can you recommend wine pairing too? Thank you. Use case (VII): Quiz Master In this example, we\u2019ll follow up with the Tutor Assistant scenario to allow it to save all the quizzes generated to a\ndatabase. As illustrated below, the idea is to have a conversation with the assistant and let it handle creating a\ndatabase for you. A prerequisite for this template is to create a database with a collection named \u2018Quiz\u2019 in your project. Learn more on Buildship Databases (opens in a new tab) You can also download the template Quiz Master (opens in a new tab) as a starting point. We are gonna use the following structure to save each generated quiz: question : the specific quiz question presented to the user options : a list of 4 options to choose from correctAnswer: The answer to the question keywords : autogenerated keywords for later organizing the questions Below example of how your database would look like after interacting with Quiz Master \ud83d\udc47 You are all set. Now it\u2019s time to teach our Assistant to use tools to fill this database. To do that, we must assume two\nmain aspects: You have to properly describe the given tools , together with their parameters. Eg: Send email: This function calls\nGmail API and send an email You have to specify the desired action on your request. Eg: send a happy NY greeting to my contacts Let\u2019s see how to do it with our Quiz master. Step 1. Add nodes and describe them First of all, we\u2019ll add the Create Document from Buildship Database. As you will see, you can add any nodes you want and teach the Assistant how to use them. The most important aspect to\nconsider is to provide proper descriptions of what this node should do. In our example, we\u2019ll update both the name and the description of the node: \u26a0\ufe0f Original Name \u2192 Create document Original Description \u2192 Creates or updates a document in a specified Firestore collection New Name : updateDatabase New Description : save the latest quiz to the database Note how we also provide information on how we are gonna handle the data within the description of the node. This is\nbecause when using Assistant with tools, all the node information is also considered to answer a user message. Based on\nthis information, together with the Instructions and user prompt the assistant will decide how to answer. Internally, we are describing our nodes as functions (opens in a new tab) that the Assistant will intelligently\ndecide to use. We are not adding any extra prompting on user requests, so everything you describe is what the assistant\nis gonna use to decide. Once you have described the node, you are gonna decide which inputs you provide and which ones the Assistant will be\nresponsible for filling in. Let\u2019s see how to do that \ud83d\udc47 Step 2. Decide which inputs will be auto-filled Assistant can intelligently fill in the inputs from your tools. To do that, you must consider which context and\naccessible information is available for it. You are responsible for filling in inputs related to information you are not sending to OpenAI. For example your secret\nKeys or labels from your internal database. In addition, we also recommend filling the inputs we know they are not gonna\nchange. For example, if you want to always send an email from a certain address it\u2019s better to define it yourself. All the information you fill will not be visible, nor modified by the Assistant. As an example, in our Quiz Master we\nalready provide information about the Collection name \u2018Quiz\u2019 and we leave all the other default values. To tell the Assistant to fill in an input we must enable it by pressing the icon next to it. Then, as before, it\u2019s better to provide context about how this input will be filled. Providing context on what is this\ninput, how it is used or which its expected format will guide the Assistant to correctly provide this information \u26a0\ufe0f Input Name \u2192 Data Input Description \u2192 The data to set in the document New Name : Quiz data New Description : The quiz data in JSON format with fields: question, options, correctAnswer, keywords Your node is ready to be used by the Assistant, now we only need to update it in our instructions. Step 3. Modify the instructions Finally, let\u2019s update our instructions. It\u2019s important to imagine the possible scenarios when using the Assistant. For\nexample, you can decide if you want to ask first to the user about the topic of the quiz or you can decide it yourself.\nAs an example, this is the instructions we use. INSTRUCTIONS : You are a personal history tutor. You will answer questions in a concise way. You must also engage with users by creating little quizzes with 4 possible options to answer each question. When you are given tools to use, you must use them following the guidelines for each tool. Guidelines: - If a new quiz is generated you must use 'updateDatabase' tool to save the latest quiz to the database\" First of all, we provide context on what\u2019s the task to accomplish together with some guidance on how to act when a user\ndoesn\u2019t ask anything. Then we describe the actions to be done: first, generate the quiz with options and then save it to\nthe database with the newly defined tool \u2018updateDatabase\u2019 Ready! You can now test out your new Assistant. Once you test it, note how we inform you that the tool has been used via\nthe Green Run icon. You have learned a basic example of how to use BuildShip nodes with the Assistant. Let\u2019s now learn how to combine using\nnodes and workflows together with the Assistant. Use case (VIII): Email Assistant Using BuildShip we can also teach our Assistants to use workflows as tools. In this example, we are gonna build an\nAssistant that generates responses and sends emails to your contacts. To do that you can download the Mail Assistant\ntemplate. A prerequisite for this tutorial is to create a collection within BuildShip named contacts and a basic workflow to\naccess it. You can copy this template (opens in a new tab) and\npaste it into a new workflow. Make sure that your collection has the field name and email set. Step 1. Create the Assistant Let\u2019s start by giving the task and the context to the assistant. We are also describing the tools it's gonna use and\nsome extra information on how to handle if users refer to themselves INSTRUCTIONS : You are specialized in sending emails with a concise response given a context. Users will describe the message they want to send and the expected recipient. When you are given tools to use, you must use them following the guidelines for each tool. Guidelines: - After accessing contacts must use 'send email' tool to send an email using Gmail API - You must always use 'get contacts' to access contacts and return a list of emails Step 2. Add the nodes and describe them Let\u2019s now add the Send Email tool. In this scenario, note how all the inputs except the sender's email will be\nauto-filled by the AI. Then, we add the node Execute Workflow to the Assistant and we update its name and description. Then we provide the\nrespective workflow ID to be called (more in our guide (opens in a new tab) ) \u26a0\ufe0f Name \u2192 Execute Workflow Description \u2192 Executes a BuildShip Workflow using the BuildShip Trigger on the target workflow. \u2728 Name \u2192 get contacts Description \u2192 a function to access contacts and return a list of emails In this case, we don\u2019t tell the Assistant to fill in any information, since we expect this workflow to return the list\nof users. Step 3. Test it out We are all set! If we test this workflow and ask to reach out to a contact from our database we can check in our Gmail\naccount that a new message will be sent correctly! You can explore different instructions to guide the Assistant on how to respond. As a simple example, you can tell the\nAssistant how to sign the message. INSTRUCTIONS : You are specialized in sending emails with a concise response given a context. Users will describe the message they want to send and the expected recipient. When you are given tools to use, you must use them following the guidelines for each tool. Guidelines: - After accessing contacts must use 'send email' tool to send an email using Gmail API - Always must use 'get contacts' to access contacts and return a list of emails Your signature should be always: AI curated message from Mail Assistant Remember that providing good context and instructions is relevant when talking with AI agents and asking them to perform\ntasks. Conclusion We hope that this guide helps you better understand how to use and integrate Assistants into our own workflows. We\nimagine By combining Assistants together with BuildShip you can explore many interesting scenarios: Custom chats : use AI capabilities to create a chat in your own product. Chat with your data : create assistants that access your knowledge to respond Seamless integration with your apps : make them use your tools like Gmail, Supabase, etc Teams of AI agents : divide tasks into multiple assistants and make them handle As you will see, making them use tools requires a good tool description and detailed instructions. If you give them more\nautonomy, they can end up deciding not to use the tools as you expect. We recommend using the following Instructions prompt structure when using Assistant + tools {Your Instructions} When you are given tools to use, you must use them following the guidelines for each tool Guidelines: {tool condition} you must use '{toolName}' to {toolDescription} \u2139\ufe0f Guidelines on how to prevent execssive token usage: Minimize Back-and-Forth: When you have an ongoing back-and-forth with the assistant, the entire thread including previous prompts and responses is passed back with every new prompt, meaning your prompt token cost increases rapidly. Don't have long chats, to cut down on token usage. Start a chat over at the beginning of each new task. API Functionality: Enabling certain Assistant API functions (function calls, retrieval, and code interpreter), adds significant amount of text to system prompt. Learn more (opens in a new tab) . Structured Data: Prefer using the code interpreter over file_search for structured data like CSV files. To succeed, we also provide a set of guidelines for defining instructions based on our explorations: Use the name of the tool . E.g: use 'Send email' tool Don\u2019t make assumptions , AI doesn\u2019t have content. E.g: inform Gerard to update the guide on prompting \u2192 inform\nGerard, from my contacts Use imperative to force using the tool. E.g: you must save to the database, Provide a clear sequence of actions . E.g: first generate an idea and then send it to client Imagine and describe possible logical paths . E.g: if you need more information, ask the user before sending a\nmessage Provide examples of formatting when needed. E.g: data in a json format {name:value email:value} We are gonna keep updating this guide with more use cases and recommendations.

Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 AI Assistant Groq Assistant Groq Assistant The Groq AI Assistant Node is a powerful tool that allows you to create and interact with an AI-powered\nconversational assistant. It leverages the capabilities of the Groq platform, which provides access to large language\nmodels and natural language processing capabilities. Setting Up the Groq Assistant Step 1: Adding the Groq Assistant Node In your BuildShip Workflow canvas, click on the + Add Node button. In the search bar, type Groq AI Assistant and\nclick on the node to add it to your canvas. Step 2: Adding the Groq API Key The Groq AI Assistant Node requires an API key to connect to the Groq platform. You can obtain an API key by signing up\non the Groq Console (opens in a new tab) . Once you have the API key, paste it into the API Key field in\nthe Groq AI Assistant Node settings. \ud83d\udca1 RECOMMENDED: Use BuildShip Secrets to securely store your API key and re-use it across multiple workflows. Learn\nmore . Step 3: Add in the Instructions You can now configure the Groq AI Assistant Node by adding in the instructions that you want the assistant to follow.\nThis is like a System Prompt for the Groq AI Assistant to set a context for the conversation. For Example: You are a helpful travel assistant providing recommendations for vacation destinations based on the user's preferences. Step 4: Passing the User Prompt The User Prompt is the input that the user provides to the assistant. You can pass in the User Prompt from the body of\nthe incoming request to the workflow. The Groq AI Assistant Node will use this input, along with the Instructions to\ngenerate a response. For Example: I'm planning a family vacation next summer. We enjoy outdoor activities like hiking and camping, and we'd like to go somewhere with beautiful scenery and moderate temperatures. Can you suggest some good destinations for us? You can pass in the User Prompt from the body of the incoming request as follows: Step 5: Configure the Tokens and Model Optionally, users can set the maximum number of tokens (units of text) that the AI assistant's response can contain. The\ndefault value is 1024 . Select the specific language model to be used by the AI assistant. The available options are LLaMA3 70b , LLaMA3 8b , Mixtral 8x7b , and Gemma 7b . The default model is LLaMA3 8b . Step 6: Thread ID Optionally, provide a thread ID to maintain the conversation history between the user and the AI assistant. If provided,\nthe node will retrieve the previous messages from the specified thread and include them in the context for the current\nresponse. Learn more on how the Assistant maintains the conversation history . Chat History The Groq Assistants, like all other assistants, maintains the chat history by storing the conversation messages in your\nBuildShip Storage associated with your project. If a threadId is provided, the node will attempt to load the previous\nmessages from the corresponding history. If the history does not exist, a new conversation thread is started. After each\nresponse from the AI assistant, the node appends the latest messages to the chat history, ensuring that the conversation\nhistory is preserved for future interactions. Outputs The Groq AI Assistant Node returns the following outputs: Message : The response generated by the AI assistant based on the User Prompt and Instructions. Thread ID : The unique identifier for the conversation thread. This can be used to maintain the conversation\nhistory between the user and the AI assistant. Data : The complete response object from the Groq API, which includes additional metadata and information about the\nAI assistant's response.

The access tokens you've encountered thus far are essentially\nephemeral. It's likely that you aim to enable your application to interact with the API beyond a mere 24-hour timeframe,\nwhich necessitates the creation of a more enduring access token. All you need to do is add a System User to your business account to obtain an access token you can use to continue\naccessing the API. To create a system user, do the following: Go to Business Settings here (opens in a new tab) . Select the business account your app is associated with. Below Users, click System Users. Click Add. Name the system user, choose Admin as the user role, and click Create System User. Select the whatsapp_business_messaging permission. Click Generate New Token. Copy and save your token. Your access token is a random string of letters and numbers. \ud83d\udca1 Use the WhatsApp Bot Trigger to automate the process of sending messages to your\ncustomers.

Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 Postgres Integration with BuildShip BuildShip offers a seamless integration with PostgreSQL using BuildShip's pre-built Postgres Integration nodes, enabling\nyou to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on your database effortlessly. You can find the Postgres Integration nodes under the Integrations section of the node explorer. Prerequisites \u2705 Before you get started with integrating PostgreSQL into BuildShip, ensure you have the following: PostgreSQL Database You should have access to a PostgreSQL database. If you don't have one, you can set it up easily. You can host your\nPostgreSQL database using various providers and methods, including: Self-Hosted : You may have a self-hosted PostgreSQL database on your own server or infrastructure. Cloud-Based : PostgreSQL can be hosted on cloud platforms like AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, or Azure Database for\nPostgreSQL. Serverless : Consider using a serverless PostgreSQL service like NEON (opens in a new tab) (which is used in\nthis tutorial as an example) for a hassle-free and scalable database setup. Connection String Parameters Retrieve the connection string parameters for your PostgreSQL database. You'll need the following: Host : The host of your PostgreSQL database. Database Name : The name of your PostgreSQL database. User : The username to access your PostgreSQL database. Password : The password associated with the user. Let's walk through with an example of how you can use these nodes to perform CRUD operations on your PostgreSQL\ndatabase. In this example, we'll be using a PostgreSQL database hosted on NEON (opens in a new tab) . On BuildShip,\nwe can begin with a new workflow with any Trigger of your preference. In this example, we'll be using a REST API Trigger . Fetching Table Schema To fetch the schema of a table in your PostgreSQL database, you can use the Fetch Postgres Table Schema node. Open\nthe Node Explorer, under the Integrations section, select the Postgres category, and select the Fetch Postgres\nTable Schema node to be added to the workflow. Add in your PostgreSQL database's connection string parameters and the table name as input. You can also open\nthe Node Editor (by clicking on the </> icon) to test and modify the existing node. \ud83d\udca1 Using Secrets to store passwords It's always a good practice to use the Secrets to store your database's connection string password or other\nsensitive data. You can then use the Secrets node to retrieve the values of the secrets and use them as inputs for\nthe Postgres Integration nodes. Learn more about using Secrets in BuildShip. Sample Output: [ { \"column_name\" : \"breed_id\" , \"data_type\" : \"integer\" , \"character_maximum_length\" : null } , { \"column_name\" : \"breed_name\" , \"data_type\" : \"character varying\" , \"character_maximum_length\" : 100 } , { \"column_name\" : \"origin\" , \"data_type\" : \"character varying\" , \"character_maximum_length\" : 100 } , { \"column_name\" : \"average_weight\" , \"data_type\" : \"numeric\" , \"character_maximum_length\" : null } ] Fetching Table Data To fetch the data of a table in your PostgreSQL database, you can use the Fetch Postgres Table Data node from the\nNode Explorer. You can also use a parameterized query to fetch data based on a condition. The Condition Column and Condition Value inputs are optional. If you don't provide these inputs, the node will fetch all the data from the\ntable. Add in your PostgreSQL database's connection string parameters and the table name as input. Test and modify the\nnode via the Node Editor (by clicking on the </> icon). Let's say we need to fetch the data for the breed_name Doberman Pinscher from the dog_breeds table. We'll add the conditionColumn as breed_name and conditionValue as Doberman Pinscher . Example Output: [ { \"breed_id\" : 2 , \"breed_name\" : \"German Shepherd\" , \"origin\" : \"Germany\" , \"average_weight\" : \"75.00\" } ] Inserting Data To insert data into a table in your PostgreSQL database, you can use the Insert Data into Postgres DB node from the\nNode Explorer. Let's say we need to insert a new row into the dog_breeds table with the following data: [ { \"breed_id\" : 8 , \"breed_name\" : \"Doberman Pinscher\" , \"origin\" : \"Germany\" , \"average_weight\" : 75 } , { \"breed_id\" : 9 , \"breed_name\" : \"Shih Tzu\" , \"origin\" : \"Tibet\" , \"average_weight\" : 12 } ] Add in your PostgreSQL database's connection string parameters and the table name as input. Test and modify the\nnode via the Node Editor (by clicking on the </> icon). Output: Updating Data To update data in a table in your PostgreSQL database, you can use the Update Postgres Row Data node from the Node\nExplorer. Let's say we need to update the average_weight of the Doberman Pinscher breed to 80 in the dog_breeds table. Add in your PostgreSQL database's connection string parameters and the table name as input. The Column ID and Column Value let's you filter the row to be updated. Let's add the columnId as breed_name and columnValue as Doberman Pinscher . For the data to be updated, we'll add\nthe following JSON in the Data input: { \"average_weight\" : 80 } Output: Deleting Data To delete data from a table in your PostgreSQL database, you can use the Delete Row from Postgres node from the Node\nExplorer. Let's say we need to delete the dog breed which is originated from Tibet from the dog_breeds table. Add in your PostgreSQL database's connection string parameters and the table name as input. The Column ID and Column Value let's you filter the row to be deleted. Add the columnId as origin and columnValue as Tibet . \u26a0\ufe0f By default, a DELETE query will remove only one row when there are multiple rows that match the condition. If you want to delete all rows with a specific value in a column, including duplicates, you can use a more specific\ncondition that identifies all the rows you want to delete. You can also modify the query to use a subquery that selects\nall rows with the specified value in a column. Output: You can also create your own Postgres Integration nodes using the versatile Script Node available in the Core\nNodes section of the Node Exporer or, generate it via AI .

BuildShip Nodes let you\nbuild APIs and perform CRUD operations on your Airtable bases based on an event . Imagine you want to create a\nnew record in your Airtable base when a user signs up, or generate personalized marketing emails for your users. You can\ndo that with the Airtable Nodes. Prerequisites \u2705 Personal Access Token Airtable reccomends using a Personal Access Token for authentication. You can create a Personal Access Token by\nfollowing the steps below: Go to your Airtable Dashboard (opens in a new tab) and click on \u201c Create a Token \u201d. Add a name for the token, grant access to your desired bases or workspaces , and select the following scopes: data.records:read (opens in a new tab) data.records:write (opens in a new tab) Feel free to add any addtional scopes if you wish to create your own Airtable nodes! \ud83e\udd29 Click on \u201cCreate Token\u201d and copy the token that is generated. Recommended: Save your API Keys securely with BuildShip Secret Manager and easily re-use it in your\nnodes. Base ID Get the Base ID of the base you want to use in your Airtable node. You can find the Base ID in the URL of your base. For\nexample, if the URL of your base is https://airtable.com/appxxxxxxxxx/tblxxxxxxxxx/viwxxxxxxxx/recxxxxxxxx. , then the\nBase ID is appXXXXXXXXXXXXX . Table ID Get the Table ID of the table you want to use in your Airtable node. You can find the Table ID in the URL of your table.\nFor example, if the URL of your table is https://airtable.com/appxxxxxxxxx/tblxxxxxxxxx/viwxxxxxxxx/recxxxxxxxx. , then\nthe Table ID is tblXXXXXXXXXXXXX . Record ID Select and expand a record. Get the Record ID of the record you want to use in your Airtable node. You can find the Record ID in the URL of your\nrecord. For example, if the URL of your record is https://airtable.com/appxxxxxxxxx/tblxxxxxxxxx/viwxxxxxxxx/recxxxxxxxx. , then the Record ID is recXXXXXXXXXXXXX . \u2705 Optionally, you can create a field for Record ID in your Airtable. This will allow you to use the Record ID in your Airtable node without having to expand the record. Follow the steps below: Visit your Airtable homepage (opens in a new tab) . Open your preferred base. Click the + icon to the right of your desired table. Select the Formula > field type (opens in a new tab) and\nenter RECORD_ID() . Click Create field . Airtable Nodes Users will be able to find the Airtable Nodes in the Node Library under the Airtable integrations category. List Record The List Record Node allows you to list records from your Airtable base. To filter, sort, and format the results use Airtable's URI Encoder tool (opens in a new tab) to\ngenerate an alternate endpoint. If we choose to use the API URL , we can omit the Base ID and Table ID as adding\nthis field will override Base ID and Table ID fields. Get Record The Get Record Node allows you to get a record from your Airtable base. Use the Record ID to get the record. Create Record The Create Record Node allows you to create a record in your Airtable base. Use the Base ID and Table ID to create the\nrecord. The data to be created is passed as a an Array of JSON object . (Check the Node Info for sample inputs.) Update Record The Update Record Node allows you to update a record in your Airtable base.

It\noffers flexibility in storing data in JSON-like documents, providing users with scalability and versatility in managing\ntheir data. With BuildShip X MongoDB Nodes , users can now leverage MongoDB's capabilities to create REST APIs , Scheduled\nJobs , integrate with other databases like - Firestore , Supabase , and Airtable , build chatbots , and\nmuch more, all through a low-code approach. Prerequisites \u2705 Before proceeding, ensure you have a MongoDB project. If not, you can sign up here (opens in a new tab) and follow the guided walkthrough. \ud83d\udca1 QUICK TIP \ud83d\udca1: Make sure to add 0.0.0.0/0 under the Network Access tab to enable database access via the\nBuildShip MongoDB Nodes. Failure to do so might result in unsuccessful responses. Database Navigate to the Databases section in MongoDB, and create a database if one does not already exist. For security purposes, you'll be required to create a user with a username and password. Make note of the Database Name and Password for connecting BuildShip nodes to the MongoDB database. Connection String After creating the database user, choose a connection method. Select the driver as Node.js and copy the Connection\nString provided. It should look something like this: mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>/<database>?retryWrites=true&w=majority Replace <password> with the password set for your database user. Store this connection string separately as this will\nbe required for establishing the connection later. Collection Once the Database Name, Connection String, and database setup are complete, you can either create a new collection or\nuse an existing one for CRUD operations. MongoDB CRUD Nodes BuildShip currently offers the following pre-built MongoDB nodes. \u2b50\ufe0f Want more MongoDB nodes? Why wait for us? Create your own custom nodes using AI, learn more . Insert Document The Insert Document Node allows users to add new data entries into a MongoDB collection. It takes an array of documents\nas input and inserts them into the specified collection within the MongoDB database. After successful insertion, it\nreturns the IDs of the inserted documents. Usage: Provide the MongoDB connection string, database name, and collection name. Input an array of JSON documents to be inserted into the collection. Sample Input: [ { \"_id\" : \"document1\" , \"name\" : \"Sicilian pizza\" , \"shape\" : \"square\" } , { \"_id\" : \"document2\" , \"name\" : \"New York pizza\" , \"shape\" : \"round\" } ] Fetch Document The Fetch Document Node retrieves specific documents from a MongoDB collection based on their unique Document IDs. It\nfetches the entire document data corresponding to the provided document IDs and returns them as output. Usage: Specify the MongoDB connection string, database name, collection name, and the document ID(s) to fetch. Update Document The Update Document Node modifies existing documents in a MongoDB collection. It uses the updateOne function to update\na specific document identified by its unique ObjectID (Document ID). The node takes new JSON data as input and updates\nthe document accordingly. Usage: Provide the MongoDB connection string, database name, collection name, document ID, and new JSON data for updating the\ndocument. Sample Input: { \"name\" : \"Sicilian pizza\" , \"shape\" : \"square\" } Delete Document The Delete Document Node removes specific documents from a MongoDB collection based on their unique IDs. It deletes\ndocument identified by the ObjectID (Document ID) from the specified collection in the MongoDB database. Usage: Specify the MongoDB connection string, database name, collection name, and the document ID to delete. Query Collection The Query Collection Node retrieves multiple documents from a MongoDB collection based on specified criteria. It allows\nusers to query documents using parameters like the connection string, database name, collection name, query, sort, and\nprojection. Usage: Provide the MongoDB connection string, database name, collection name, and query criteria. Optionally, specify sorting and projection parameters to organize and filter the returned documents. Sample Input: Query to return only Pizza with a cooking time of less than 60 minutes: { \"time\" : { \"$lt\" : 60 } } Sorting by name in ascending order: { \"name\" : 1 } Projection to include only the name , time , and _id fields: { \"name\" : 1 , \"time\" : 1 , \"_id\" : 1 } Need Help? \ud83d\udcac Join BuildShip Community An active and large community of no-code / low-code builders.

Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 MongoDB Search Integration The MongoDB Search Integration in BuildShip enables users to leverage MongoDB for their advanced search and indexing\nneeds through a streamlined, low-code interface. MongoDB offers powerful full-text search, vector search, and hybrid\nsearch capabilities, making it possible to build highly relevant and sophisticated search experiences within your\napplications and websites. BuildShip's MongoDB Search Nodes enable easy connection to MongoDB instances, allowing the creation of APIs, scheduled\njobs, and search-centric workflows. These MongoDB Search Nodes offer a no-code interface for advanced search features, simplifying tasks such as indexing\ndocuments, adjusting settings, and performing complex queries. This makes managing search functionalities efficient and\naccessible within the intuitive BuildShip environment. Get Started \u2705 Full Text Search: Quick and Efficient Document Retrieval \u2192 Creating Embeddings: Laying the Groundwork for Advanced Searches \u2192 Semantic Search: Finding Meaning in Your Data \u2192 Hybrid Search: Combining Power of Semantic and Full Text Search \u2192 Prerequisites \u2705 Before you can start using the MongoDB Search Nodes in BuildShip, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in\nplace: MongoDB Atlas Project You'll need access to a MongoDB Atlas project. Follow these steps to prepare your account and initiate your first\nproject: Navigate to MongoDB Atlas (opens in a new tab) to either sign up for a new account or log in if you\nare an existing user. Create a new project and configure your database as needed with sample data. For detailed instructions on setting up your MongoDB Atlas project and integrating it with BuildShip, please refer to BuildShip X MongoDB docs (opens in a new tab) . Full Text Search You must configure an Atlas Search index to query data in your Atlas cluster using MongoDB Full Text Search node. Atlas\nSearch indexes enable faster retrieval of documents using certain identifiers. The \"Full Text Search\" node allows you to\nperform full-text searches on a MongoDB collection, enabling you to find documents that match a specific search query. To set up MongoDB full text search in your BuildShip workflow, you first need to create a Search index Create an Atlas Search index In Atlas, go to the Clusters page for your project. Go to the Atlas Search page for your cluster. Select Atlas Search Visual Editor under Atlas Search Configuration Method and click Next Enter the Index Name ( fts ), and set the Database and Collection. Click Create Search Index. \ud83d\udca1 The index should be created with the name fts if you don't want to change the Index Name in the node. You can\ncreate this index using the Atlas UI. Alternatively, you can create it using the Atlas Search API and Atlas CLI. You\ncan find detailed documentation of this in this guide (opens in a new tab) . Use the Full Text Search node to perform the search. Inputs Connection String : The MongoDB connection string. Database : The name of the database. Collection : The name of the column in the specified table where the full-text search will be conducted. Query : The search query string that you want to use for finding matching documents. Index Name : (Optional) The number of results to return. Default is 10. Output The node returns an object with the following properties: { \"success\" : boolean , \"count\" : integer , \"documents\" : [ { \"document\" : object } ] } success : A boolean value indicating the success of the operation. count : The number of documents returned by the search query. results : An array of documents resulting from the search query. Creating Embeddings To perform semantic search and hybrid search in MongoDB, you need to create embeddings for your documents. These\nembeddings represent your data as points in multi-dimensional space, capturing meaningful relationships and enabling\ntasks such as semantic search and retrieval. You can store vector embeddings along with your other data in MongoDB Atlas\nand use Atlas Vector Search to query your vectorized data. For detailed documentation on create embeddings refer to this guide (opens in a new tab) To create embeddings for your MongoDB Collection, follow these steps: Generate Embeddings with OpenAI Use the Buildship OpenAI Generate Embeddings Node to create embeddings for each document's content. Retrieve Collection Documents Use the Query Collection node to retrieve all the documents from the collection with the specified fields. In this\ncase, you only need the _id and content of each document. Update Embedding Column For each document, update the new embedding field value using the Generate Embeddings node and MongoDB Update Document node enclosed in a Repeat node. For a streamlined implementation, you can use this Remix template (opens in a new tab) as shown in the image below: \ud83d\udca1 This step is necessary for performing semantic searches and hybrid searches later. Semantic Search You must configure an Atlas Vector Search index to query data in your Atlas cluster using MongoDB Semantic Search. Atlas\nVector Search indexes enable efficient retrieval of documents based on vector similarity. The \"Semantic Search\" node\nallows you to perform semantic searches on a MongoDB collection, enabling you to find documents that match the semantic\nmeaning of a search query. To set up MongoDB semantic search in your workflow, you first need to create a Vector Search index. Create an Atlas Vector Search Index In Atlas, go to the Clusters page for your project. Go to the Atlas Search page for your cluster. Select JSON Editor under Atlas Vector Search Method and click Next Enter the Index Name ( vector_index ), and set the Database and Collection. { \"fields\" : [ { \"type\" : \"vector\" , \"path\" : \"embedding\" , \"numDimensions\" : 1536 , \"similarity\" : \"euclidean\" } ] } type : Indicates the field type, set to \"vector\" for vector embeddings. path : Path to the field containing vector embeddings. count : Number of dimensions in the vectors (use 1536 if using OpenAI embeddings). results : Function for comparing vectors ( \"euclidean\" , \"cosine\" , or \"dotProduct\" ).

Supabase provides efficient full-text search, semantic search,\nand hybrid search capabilities to create highly relevant search experiences within your applications and website. Leveraging BuildShip's Supabase Nodes, users can seamlessly connect to their Supabase instances, unlocking the potential\nto craft APIs, Scheduled Jobs, and various backend workflows centered around search and indexing tasks . This\nintegration is specially crafted to reduce the need for extensive coding, facilitating straightforward management of\nsearch indices, documents, and configurations within the intuitive BuildShip environment. The Supabase Nodes provide a no-code interface for engaging with Supabase, ensuring a hassle-free integration of\nadvanced search features into your projects. From indexing new documents and tweaking search settings to conducting\nintricate search queries, Supabase Nodes are designed to streamline these processes in a user-friendly manner. Prerequisites \u2705 Before you can start using the Supabase Nodes in BuildShip, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place: Supabase Project You'll need access to a Supabase project. Follow these steps to prepare your account and initiate your first project: Navigate to Supabase (opens in a new tab) to either sign up for a new account or log in if you are an existing\nuser. Create a new project and configure your database as needed. It's important to note, generating API keys for secure interaction with your Supabase instance is an important step that\nfollows the establishment of your project. API Key Supabase utilizes API keys to authenticate, granting complete operational access. For enhanced security, it is\nrecommended to generate new API keys (opens in a new tab) with restricted scopes tailored to specific\nuse cases. \ud83d\udca1 Supabase provides two types of API keys. You can find more details in this API Key\nDocumentation (opens in a new tab) . API URL Supabase projects are uniquely identified by their API URL which you can retrieve from your project's API settings in\nthe Supabase Dashboard. For more details on obtaining your Supabase instance's URL, refer to the Supabase documentation (opens in a new tab) . For comprehensive guidance on setting up the Supabase project, please refer to the Supabase Tutorial (opens in a new tab) . For the Full Text Search, Semantic Search, and Hybrid Search nodes, suppose you have a Supabase table called documents with the columns id , title , content , and created_at . You can follow along with this guide to try out the nodes. You can create the documents table with the following SQL code: CREATE TABLE documents ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY , title TEXT NOT NULL , content TEXT NOT NULL , created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ); Add some sample data to the above table as described in the \"Creating Data\" (opens in a new tab) section. Full Text Search The \"Full Text Search\" node allows you to perform full-text searches on a Supabase table, enabling you to find documents\nthat match a specific search query. To set up supabase full text search in your BuildShip workflow, follow these steps: Add Full Text Search Column Add a full-text search ( fts ) column to the table you want to search within. Lets add a fts column to the documents table which we have created earlier. ALTER TABLE documents ADD COLUMN fts TSVECTOR GENERATED ALWAYS AS (to_tsvector( 'english' , content)) STORED; TSVECTOR is a PostgreSQL data type used for storing text search vectors, which are optimized representations of text\nfor full-text search. This specifies that the fts column is a computed column, automatically generated based on the\ncontent of another column ( content in this case). Create Index Create an index for the full-text search. CREATE INDEX ON documents USING gin(fts); This command creates an index on the fts column of the documents table. It allows fast lookups of documents that\ncontain specific words or phrases. \ud83d\udca1 Adding a TSVECTOR column and creating a GIN index significantly enhances the performance of full-text search\nqueries by reducing the time and resources needed to find matching documents. By converting the content into a\nTSVECTOR and indexing it, PostgreSQL can quickly identify relevant documents based on the search terms, making\nsearches much faster than scanning the entire table. Inputs API Key : The API key required for authentication with your Supabase instance. This should be provided as a secret. API URL : The host address of your Supabase instance. This can be provided as a secret. Table Name : The Supabase table name where you want to perform the search. Column Name : The name of the column in the specified table where the full-text search will be conducted. Query : The search query string that you want to use for finding matching documents. Match Count : (Optional) The number of results to return. Default is 10. Search Type : (Optional) The type of full-text search to perform. ( plain , phrase , and websearch ) \ud83d\udca1 Use the \"Full Text Search\" node when you need to search for documents in a Supabase table based on a specific query.\nThis can be useful in various scenarios, such as implementing search functionality in your application, finding\nrelevant data based on user input, or filtering data based on specific criteria. Output The node returns an object with the following properties: { \"success\" : boolean , \"results\" : [ { \"row\" : object } ] } success : A boolean value indicating the success of the operation. results : An array of objects, each representing an object that matched the search query. The row property contains\nthe full row data. Creating Embeddings To perform semantic search hybrid search you need to create embeddings for your documents. Vectors in Supabase are\nenabled via pgvector (opens in a new tab) , a PostgreSQL extension for storing and querying vectors\nin Postgres.It can be used to store embeddings (opens in a new tab) . For\nthis you have to enable the vector extention which will give access to a new data type called vector . If you want\nmore information You can use this guide (opens in a new tab) to enable the extention. To enable it via sql command you can use below SQL code. create extension vector with schema extensions; To create embeddings for your supabase table, follow these steps: Add Embedding Column Add an embedding column to the documents table: ALTER TABLE documents ADD COLUMN embedding VECTOR( 1536 ); Generate Embeddings Generate Embeddings with OpenAI: Use the Buildship OpenAI Generate Embeddings Node to create embeddings for each\ndocument's content. Retrieve Table Documents: Use the Get Columns node to retrieve all the documents from the table with the specified\ncolumns. In this case, you only need the id and content of each row. Update Embedding Column: For each row, update the new embedding column value using the Generate Embeddings node\nand Supabase Update Row node enclosed in a Repeat node. For a streamlined implementation, you can use this Remix template (opens in a new tab) as shown in the image below: \ud83d\udca1 This step is necessary for performing semantic searches and hybrid searches later. Semantic Search Semantic search enables you to find documents that match the meaning of a search query. The Supabase \"Semantic Search\"\nnode allows you to perform semantic searches on a Supabase table, enabling you to find documents that match the meaning\nof a search query. \ud83d\udca1 Ensure your table has data and embeddings added as described above. To set up supabase semantic search in your BuildShip workflow, follow these steps: Create Index To perform efficient semantic vector searches, you need to create an index on the embedding column in your table. This\nindex uses the HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithm, which is suitable for high-dimensional vector data. Create an index for the semantic vector search: CREATE INDEX ON documents USING hnsw (embedding vector_ip_ops); Semantic Search Function To perform semantic search, you need to create a SQL function in your Supabase database to match rows based on\nembeddings. This function will help you find rows that are semantically similar to the query. It is crucial that the\nfunction is named semantic_search , as the node requires this specific name to operate correctly. CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION semantic_search ( query_embedding VECTOR( 1536 ), match_threshold FLOAT , match_count INT ) RETURNS SETOF your_table LANGUAGE SQL AS $$ SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE your_table.embedding <=> query_embedding < 1 - match_threshold ORDER BY your_table.embedding <=> query_embedding ASC LIMIT LEAST (match_count, 200 ); $$; In this example, replace your_table with the name of the table you are working with. The function will search for rows\nwithin the specified table that are semantically similar to the provided query embedding. \ud83d\udca1 Use the semantic_search function to perform semantic search queries. This function compares the embeddings stored in\nthe documents table with the embedding of the search query, returning documents that are semantically similar. Use the Semantic Search node to perform the search. Inputs API Key : The API key required for authentication with your Supabase instance. This should be provided as a secret. API URL : The host address of your Supabase instance. This can be provided as a secret. OpenAI Key : The API key required for authentication with OpenAI. This should be provided as a secret. Open AI Model : The embedding model to use (e.g., 'text-embedding-ada-002'). Query : The search query string that you want to use for finding matching documents. Match Threshold : (Optional) The threshold for matching results. Match Count : (Optional) The number of results to return. Output The node returns an object with the following properties: { \"success\" : boolean , \"results\" : [ { \"row\" : object } ] } success : A boolean value indicating the success of the operation. results : An array of objects, each representing an object that matched the search query. The row property contains\nthe full row data. Hybrid Search The Hybrid Search feature in Supabase combines traditional keyword search with semantic vector search, enabling you to\nfind documents that are relevant both textually and semantically.The Supabase \"Hybrid Search\" node allows you to perform\nhybrid searches on a Supabase table, enabling you to find documents that match the meaning of a search query. To set up supabase hybrid search in your BuildShip workflow, follow these steps: Create the fts and embedding columns for the documents table as described in the Full Text Search and Semantic Search sections. The table should look like below after adding fts and embedding columns: Hybrid Search Function To perform hybrid search, you need to create a SQL function in your Supabase database to match rows based on embeddings\nand full-text search. This function will help you find rows that are semantically and textually similar to the query. It\nis crucial that the function is named hybrid_search , as the node requires this specific name to operate correctly. CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION hybrid_search ( QUERY_TEXT TEXT , QUERY_EMBEDDING VECTOR( 1536 ), MATCH_COUNT INT , FULL_TEXT_WEIGHT FLOAT = 1 , SEMANTIC_WEIGHT FLOAT = 1 , RRF_K INT = 50 ) RETURNS SETOF your_table LANGUAGE SQL AS $$ WITH full_text AS ( SELECT id, ROW_NUMBER () OVER ( ORDER BY ts_rank_cd(fts, websearch_to_tsquery(QUERY_TEXT)) DESC ) AS rank_ix FROM your_table WHERE fts @@ websearch_to_tsquery(QUERY_TEXT) LIMIT LEAST (MATCH_COUNT, 30 ) * 2 ), semantic AS ( SELECT id, ROW_NUMBER () OVER ( ORDER BY embedding < # > QUERY_EMBEDDING) AS rank_ix FROM your_table LIMIT LEAST (MATCH_COUNT, 30 ) * 2 ) SELECT your_table. * FROM full_text FULL OUTER JOIN semantic ON full_text.id = semantic.id JOIN your_table ON COALESCE (full_text.id, semantic.id) = your_table.id ORDER BY COALESCE ( 1 . 0 / (RRF_K + full_text.rank_ix), 0 . 0 ) * FULL_TEXT_WEIGHT + COALESCE ( 1 . 0 / (RRF_K + semantic.rank_ix), 0 . 0 ) * SEMANTIC_WEIGHT DESC LIMIT LEAST (MATCH_COUNT, 30 ); $$; In this example, replace your_table with the name of the table you are working with. The function will perform a\nhybrid search within the specified table, combining both full-text search and semantic search to find rows that are\nrelevant to the provided query text and embedding. \ud83d\udca1 Employ the \"Hybrid Search\" function to enhance search functionality in your applications by delivering results that\nnot only match the keywords but also align semantically with the user's intent. This function is particularly\nbeneficial in providing more relevant and context-aware search results, thereby improving the user experience. Use the Hybrid Search node to perform the search. Inputs API Key : The API key required for authentication with your Supabase instance. This should be provided as a secret. API URL : The host address of your Supabase instance. This can be provided as a secret. OpenAI Key : The API key required for authentication with OpenAI. This should be provided as a secret. Open AI Model : The embedding model to use (e.g., 'text-embedding-ada-002'). Query : The search query string that you want to use for finding matching documents. Match Count : The number of results to return. Full Text Weight : The weight for full-text search component in the hybrid search. Semantic Weight : The weight for semantic search component in the hybrid search. rrfK : The K constant for the Relative Ranking Factor (RRF) used in the search. Output The node returns an object with the following properties: { \"success\" : boolean , \"results\" : [ { \"row\" : object } ] } success : A boolean value indicating the success of the operation. results : An array of objects, each representing an object that matched the search query.

Follow\nthese steps to prepare your account and initiate your first project: Navigate to Meilisearch Cloud (opens in a new tab) to either sign up for a new account or log in\nif you are an existing user. Upon login, initiate a project by selecting the \"New project\" or \"Start free trial\" button, contingent on the current\nstatus of your account. Projects serve as containers for indexes, tasks, and various critical components. Assign a name to your project, for instance, \"meilisearch-quick-start\", and choose the region that is nearest to you\nto ensure the best performance. Proceed by clicking on \"Create project\". For accounts not utilizing a free trial, you will need to select a billing plan that suits the scale of your data and\nthe volume of searches you anticipate. Post project creation, a brief waiting period may ensue for it to become ready. This process's progress can be\nmonitored in the project list. Once the project is set up, you can begin adding documents and conducting searches. It's important to note, generating API keys for secure interaction with your Meilisearch instance is an important step\nthat follows the establishment of your project.

Copy the Service Account details as you will need this information to grant access to your GCP project. \ud83d\udca1 Each BuildShip project uses one service account to integrate with external services. Once integrated, you can access\nyour GCP Projects via nodes across any workflow inside your project. Grant Access in Firebase IAM & Admin Open a new browser tab or window and go to your Firebase Project's Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console. Navigate to the IAM & Admin section from the Firebase project's GCP Console. Click on the \"Grant Access\" button to add a new principal. Paste the Service Account details you copied from BuildShip into the \"New Principal\" field. Assign the role of \"Storage Admin\" to the Service Account. Hit the \"Save\" button to grant access to the Service Account. \u2705 If you've already granted permissions to the BuildShip Runtime Service Account for connecting your Firebase Project,\nclick on the edit icon on the same service account and add the \"Storage Admin\" permission as well. This will enable\nyou to use both Firebase and GCP Nodes in your workflows. Getting your Storage Bucket ID Go to your Google Cloud Console and navigate to the\n\" Cloud Storage Buckets (opens in a new tab) \" section. Here, you'll see all the buckets\navailable in your GCP Project. You can either choose an existing bucket or create a new one from here. Click on the name of the bucket you want to use and copy the Bucket ID from this location. Insert a Google Cloud Storage Node From the Node Explorer within BuildShip, insert a Google Cloud Storage integration node into your workflow. Add the Bucket ID of your GCP project to which you want to add the data. \ud83d\udca1 All the nodes within BuildShip are well-documented. If you need help with how to add specific inputs or understand the\nfunctionality of a particular node, click on the info icon on the node. This will pop up the documentation for that\nspecific node, which includes links and examples to guide you through the process.

Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 Storage AWS S3 Bring Your Own Storage with AWS S3 BuildShip's AWS S3 Bucket Nodes enable users to interact with AWS S3 Bucket Storage, allowing them to store various\ntypes of files such as images, audio, and video in cloud buckets. Users can bring their own storage using AWS S3 Bucket. Prerequisites \u2705 An AWS Account Before using the AWS S3 Bucket nodes, ensure you have an AWS account. If you don't have one, you can sign up for a free account (opens in a new tab) . Additionally, create an S3 Storage Bucket. For guidance, refer to\nthe Getting Started (opens in a new tab) section by Amazon. Access Credentials Make sure to gather the following access credentials: Region Access ID (AWS Access Key ID) Access Secret (AWS Secret Access Key) Bucket Name \ud83d\udca1 NOTE: Modify the bucket permissions to allow ACL (Access Control List) , and uncheck the \u201c Block all public access \u201d. This can be done via the Permissions tab in the Bucket settings . AWS S3 Nodes BuildShip offers the following pre-built nodes for interacting with AWS S3 Bucket Storage. Feel free to customize them , or create your own using AI to suit your\nspecific needs. Upload File from External URL This node allows users to upload a file from an external URL to an AWS S3 Bucket. It provides a convenient way to\ntransfer files from other sources directly to the S3 bucket. Required Inputs: Region: The AWS region to which this client will send requests. Access ID: Your AWS Access Key ID. Access Secret: AWS Secret Access Key. Bucket Name: The name of the Bucket to fetch the file from. File Path: The path of the file. Example: Suppose you have a folder assets with a file og-image.jpg in your\nS3 bucket bucketName , then the Key would be: assets/og-image.jpg Create File This node creates a file with the given content in an AWS S3 bucket. It allows users to dynamically generate files and\nstore them directly in the S3 bucket. Required Inputs: Region: The AWS region to which this client will send requests. Access ID: Your AWS Access Key ID. Access Secret: AWS Secret Access Key. Bucket Name: The name of the Bucket to fetch the file from. File Path: The path of the file. Example: Suppose you have a folder assets with a file og-image.jpg in your\nS3 bucket bucketName , then the Key would be: assets/og-image.jpg File Content: The content of the file to be created. Upload Base64 File This node uploads a Base64 encoded file to an AWS S3 bucket. It is useful when dealing with file data encoded in Base64\nformat. In some scenarios, you may receive file data in Base64 format from external sources or APIs. This node allows you to\ndirectly upload such files to your S3 bucket without the need for additional encoding or decoding steps. Required Inputs: Region: The AWS region to which this client will send requests. Access ID: Your AWS Access Key ID. Access Secret: AWS Secret Access Key. Bucket Name: The name of the Bucket to fetch the file from. File Path: The path of the file. Example: Suppose you have a folder assets with a file og-image.jpg in your\nS3 bucket bucketName , then the Key would be: assets/og-image.jpg Base64 File: The Base64 string of the file to upload. Generate Public URL This node makes a file in an S3 bucket publicly accessible and returns its public URL. It is useful when you want to\nshare files stored in your S3 bucket with external users. Suppose you have media files or documents stored in your S3 bucket that need to be accessed by users outside your\norganization. You can use this node to generate public URLs for these files, allowing external users to view or download\nthem. Required Inputs: Region: The AWS region to which this client will send requests. Access ID: Your AWS Access Key ID. Access Secret: AWS Secret Access Key. Bucket Name: The name of the Bucket to fetch the file from. File Path: The path of the file. Example: Suppose you have a folder assets with a file og-image.jpg in your\nS3 bucket bucketName , then the Key would be: assets/og-image.jpg Generate Signed URL This node generates a public signed URL for a specific file in an AWS S3 bucket, providing more control over access to\nthe file. The signed URL allows temporary access to the file with specified validity. You may have files in your S3 bucket that should only be accessible for a limited time or under certain conditions. This\nnode allows you to generate signed URLs with controlled access, enhancing security and compliance. Required Inputs: Region: The AWS region to which this client will send requests. Access ID: Your AWS Access Key ID. Access Secret: AWS Secret Access Key. Bucket Name: The name of the Bucket to fetch the file from. File Path: The path of the file. Example: Suppose you have a folder assets with a file og-image.jpg in your\nS3 bucket bucketName , then the Key would be: assets/og-image.jpg Validity: The time duration for which the signed URL will be valid, in seconds. (Defaults to 7 Days ) Zip Folder This node zips an existing folder in an S3 bucket and returns a download URL for the zip file. It is useful for bundling\nmultiple files or documents stored in the S3 bucket into a single zip archive. Suppose you have a collection of files or documents stored in a folder within your S3 bucket that you want to share or\ndistribute as a single package. This node allows you to zip the folder and provide a convenient download link for the\nzip file. Required Inputs: Region: The AWS region to which this client will send requests. Access ID: Your AWS Access Key ID. Access Secret: AWS Secret Access Key. Bucket Name: The name of the Bucket to fetch the file from. Folder Path: The path of the folder to be zipped.

Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 Explore Features Export / Import API Spec OpenAPI Specification The OpenAPI Specification is a comprehensive, human-readable, and machine-readable format used to define RESTful APIs. It serves as a detailed documentation source that outlines various aspects of the API, including its methods,\noperations, responses, parameters, schemas, and more. This specification is documented in a structured series of key-value pairs following the OpenAPI structure, enabling\ndevelopers to understand and interact with the API effectively. Exporting Open API Specification BuildShip lets you export the entire structure and details of the APIs built, making it convenient for integration with\nvarious frontend applications, such as FlutterFlow. BuildShip allows users to export the OpenAPI Specification in two common formats: JSON YAML While JSON remains the standard format for OpenAPI, BuildShip also provides support for the simpler YAML\nrepresentation, offering flexibility in the choice of export format. How to export OpenAPI Specification To export the OpenAPI Specification, follow the steps below: Once you have the API workflow you wish to export, navigate to the Project Settings. Move to the \"APIs\" tab and select the specific workflow(s) for exporting. Utilize the dropdown menu available on the top right of the section to select the preferred format for exporting the\nAPI Spec \u2013 JSON or YAML. Clicking on the export option initiates the download process, providing users with a file containing the generated API\nSpecification in the chosen format. Importing API Specification \ud83d\udea7 This feature is currently under development and expected to be available soon. The Importing API Specification will enable users to create nodes and workflows by importing OpenAPI Specifications\ndirectly into BuildShip. This feature simplifies the process of building workflows based on external specifications. How to import API Specification Copy the entire API Specification file from the source. Navigate to the Node Library within BuildShip. Click on the \"Import Open API from clipboard\" feature to initiate the import process. This action adds nodes to the workflow according to the schema defined in the imported API Spec. Users can then manage\nthese nodes by copying them for reuse in other workflows/projects or deleting any nodes that are unnecessary.

Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 Explore Features Rename Node Rename Nodes BuildShip allows you to rename nodes in your workflow to improve readability and debugging experience while building\nworkflows. How to Rename Nodes To rename a node in your BuildShip workflow, follow these simple steps: Locate the node you want to rename in your BuildShip workflow. Click on the existing name of the node to enter edit mode. Type in the new name for the node. Click anywhere outside the node to save the new name. Usage Readability One of the main reasons to rename nodes is to improve the readability of your workflow. For example, if you add an empty\nscript node to create your own logic, you can rename the default \"Empty Node\" to a more descriptive name that reflects\nits purpose. Debugging The logs from each node in your workflow appear in the Logs panel, along with the node's name. Renaming nodes can help\nyou create more meaningful log statements, which can be incredibly useful for debugging purposes. For instance, if you\nhave a switch node with multiple cases, each containing a \"Log Message to Console\" node, you can rename each node to\nindicate which switch case it belongs to, making the log statements more informative.

How Skip Node Works Skip Node Operation Testing Data Input Unskipping a Node Question? Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 Explore Features Skip Nodes Skip Nodes The \" Skip Nodes \" feature is designed to allow users to bypass the execution of specific nodes within their workflows\nduring workflow testing and deployment. Why Use Skip Nodes? When dealing with nodes like the OpenAI Chat node or others that involve frequent API requests , repetitive\ntesting can be costly . The Skip Node feature allows users to exclude the execution of specific nodes during both\nworkflow testing and deployment. The Skip Node preserves the output of the node from the previous node testing and re-uses it for all subsequent\nexecutions. How Skip Node Works Skip Node Operation To skip the execution of a particular node, access the node menu. Click on the Skip Node option to enable the feature. If you have initially performed the node testing (via the\nPlay Button (\u25b9) on the node), the node will be marked with a Skip icon. Testing Data Input If the node hasn't been tested before and you wish to skip it, clicking the \" Skip Node \" button will prompt the\nnode testing menu. Input your testing data within this menu and run the test. The output generated from this testing will be stored\nfor future workflow execution. After successful testing, the node can be skipped, utilizing the stored output for subsequent workflow runs. Unskipping a Node If you wish to reintroduce the skipped nodes into live workflow execution, access the node menu again and click on\n\" Unskip \". Using the Skip Nodes feature ensures smoother development cycles by allowing selective node execution control,\noptimizing workflows during testing, and preserving tested node outputs for subsequent runs.

Environment Variables Panel 2. Inside Node Logic Getting Environment Variables Setting Environment Variables Deleting Environment Variables Question? Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 Environment Variables Environment Variables Environment variables in BuildShip are user-defined key-value pairs that can be accessed by workflow nodes. They provide\na convenient way to store and retrieve data that needs to be shared across different parts of a workflow or project. Their values can be viewed, set, and manipulated with ease via workflow nodes. Variables can be scoped at the project or workflow level , allowing better organization and access control. Types of Environment Variables BuildShip supports two types of environment variables: Project-level Variables The project-level environment variables can be accessed by any workflow within the project they are created in.\nUseful for sharing data across multiple workflows. Workflow-level Variables The workflow-level environment variables are specific to the workflow they are created in . They are useful for\nstoring data that is only relevant to a particular workflow. Using Environment Variables BuildShip offers three ways of setting and managing environment variables: 1. Environment Variables Panel You can manage environment variables directly from the BuildShip platform using the Environment Variables panel. This\npanel allows you to view, add, edit, and delete environment variables at both the project and workflow levels. To access the Environment Variables panel, click on any node input to open the quick menu, then click on the\n\"Environment Variables\" option. At the bottom click the \" Add Environment Variable \" button. This will open the panel\nwhere you can manage the variables. The Project tab displays project-level variables, while the Workflow tab displays workflow-level variables. You\ncan view, add, edit, and delete variables from these tabs as needed. 2. Inside Node Logic In addition to the pre-built nodes, you can also manipulate environment variables directly within your node logic using\nthe env object provided by BuildShip. The env object provides functions to get , set , and delete environment\nvariables. Getting Environment Variables We can use the env.get() function inside the node logic to retrieve the value of an environment variable. By default,\nthe function looks for the variable in the workflow environment scope, but you can specify the project scope as\nwell. export default function testFunctions ({ value } , { env }) { const firstValue = env .get ( 'first' ); // workflow const secondValue = env .get ( 'second' , 'project' ); // project console .log ( `firstValue: ${ firstValue } ` ); console .log ( `secondValue: ${ secondValue } ` ); // use the values in the node as you like, or return them return true ; } In this example, the function first retrieves the value of the first variable from the workflow environment, and then\nretrieves the value of the second variable from the project environment. Setting Environment Variables We can use the env.set() function to set the value of an environment variable. By default, the function sets the\nvariable in the \"workflow\" environment, but you can specify the \"project\" environment as well. export default async function testFunctions ({ value } , { env }) { await env .set ([ { name : 'first' , value : 1 } , { name : 'second' , value : 2 } , ]); // workflow await env .set ([{ name : 'third' , value : 3 }] , 'project' ); // project return true ; } In this example, the function sets the values of the first and second variables in the workflow environment, and\nthen sets the value of the third variable in the project environment. Deleting Environment Variables We can use the env.delete() function to delete an environment variable. By default, the function deletes the variable\nfrom the \"workflow\" environment, but you can specify the \"project\" environment as well. export default async function testFunctions ({ values } , { env }) { await env .delete ([ 'first' , 'second' ]); // workflow await env .delete ([ 'third' ] , 'project' ); // project return true ; } In this example, the function deletes the first and second variables from the workflow environment, and then deletes\nthe third variable from the project environment.

Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 Testing Testing The Testing feature in BuildShip's Node Editor empowers users to rigorously test their node logic without the need to\ndeploy the entire workflow . This functionality offers a dedicated space to validate your node's behavior, ensuring\nthat it handles various scenarios, including edge cases, effectively. Testing Individual Nodes During the development of your workflows, you have the ability to test individual nodes right from the Node Editor .\nThis streamlined approach allows you to validate the functionality of your nodes without the necessity of deploying the\nentire workflow. Here's how you can test individual nodes: Create or Select a Node Begin by creating a custom node using our AI Node Generator or selecting a node from the Nodeverse that aligns\nwith your workflow requirements. Open the Node Editor Access the Node Editor </> to view and modify the configuration of your chosen node. You can even customize nodes\nusing JavaScript or TypeScript to meet your specific needs. (For more information on editing nodes, refer to our guide on node customization .) Testing Nodes On the left side of the Node Editor, you'll find the Testing Node . This feature allows you to manually input\nvalues that correspond to the inputs of the node you're testing. This way, you can ensure that your node's logic\neffectively covers various edge-case scenarios. Test Node Logic Once you've input the test values, click the \" Test Node \" button. This action evaluates your node's logic against the\nprovided test case without requiring you to save or deploy the entire workflow. In case of any errors, you'll receive a\ndetailed error message, once you click on the exclamation mark, that you can use to debug your node's logic. Testing Entire Workflows Beyond testing individual nodes, BuildShip enables you to validate the functionality of your entire workflow ,\nincluding triggers and logic nodes, before deploying it. Follow the steps below to test your workflow: Build Your Workflow Create your workflow by adding triggers and logic nodes that define the sequence of actions to\nachieve your goals. (Or pick up a pre-built template or a set of pre-built nodes via the Nodeverse) Access the Testing Mode At any point in your workflow-building process, click on the \"Test\" button located in the top-right menu. Configure Parameters Before running the test, provide any necessary parameters. For instance, in the case of an HTTP Trigger, you can specify\nthe request body that your trigger will receive. Run the Test Click \" Run \" to initiate the test. Your logic nodes will execute one after another, validating their functionality. Successfully executed nodes will display a green checkmark \u2705 , while any failing nodes will be marked with a red\nexclamation mark \u2757\ufe0f . Debugging In case of node failures, the testing mode reveals the exact node responsible for the error occured. Clicking on the\nexclamation mark reveals the error code and message, helping you pinpoint and address issues efficiently. With BuildShip's testing capabilities, you can iterate through your workflow design, ensuring its effectiveness and\nidentifying any flaws or bugs before deploying it to your production environment.

Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 Logging Logging Logging plays a vital role in the development and maintenance of workflows. It allows you to track and understand the\nflow of your workflow, monitor variable values , monitor total and individual execution time of full workflow and\nindividual nodes ,and identify potential issues . Logging statements serve as essential tools in your workflow development toolkit. They offer several advantages: Debugging : Logging helps you identify and resolve issues within your workflow's logic. Monitoring : By reviewing log messages, you can monitor the execution flow, identify bottlenecks, and improve\nefficiency. Data Visualization : Logging enables you to visualize data, making it easier to understand how data changes as the\nworkflow progresses. Track Execution Time : Logging enables you to monitor workflow execution time for individual nodes and the entire\nworkflow and optimize workflows. Organize Group logs by nodes - Logging enables you to easily perform debugging and testing, allowing you to\nidentify and resolve errors efficiently. Mock Requests - Easily test and rerun a request by clicking the test button for each execution (note: headers\ncannot be accessed for security reasons). LIVE logs for test execution - Get real-time insights into your workflows for a faster debugging experience. You can harness the power of logging in BuildShip through two primary methods: Via Logging Core Node The Logging Core Node provides a straightforward way to log messages and data directly to the BuildShip logging console.\nHere's how: Add a Node Click on the \"Add a Node\" button within your workflow. This will open the Nodeverse Library, where you can explore\nvarious nodes. Find the \"Log Message to Console\" Node Within the Core Nodes section, locate the \"Log Message to Console\" node. You can also use the search bar to quickly find\nthis node. Insert and Configure the Node Insert the \"Log Message to Console\" node into your workflow. Customize the node by adding a string or variable that you want to log. Via Logging Statements in Node Logic Another way to integrate logging in your workflow is by directly adding logging statements within the logic of\nindividual nodes. This method gives you more control over when and what to log. Here's how: Select and Edit a Logic Node Choose a Logic Node within your workflow. Open the Node Editor </> to access and edit the node's logic. Import the Logging Module Inside the parameters of the node, import the logging module. This allows you to use the logging functions. export default async function yourNodeFunction ({ input } , { logging }) { // the function body logging .log ( 'This is a logging statement' ); logging .warn ( 'This is a warning message' ); logging .error ( 'This is an error message' ); } Within your node's logic, utilize the logging functions to log messages, variables, and other relevant data. Viewing the Cloud Logs After incorporating logging statements into your workflow, you can conveniently view these statements using the built-in\nlogging panel in BuildShip. The logging panel is located at the bottom of your BuildShip Workspace, initially minimized. You can simply open or close the panel using the expand button on the right to see old logs , if any. To view logs specific to a node or the entire workflow, switch from the default Workflow view to the Node view. To\nview logs for a particular node, select the node from the Node View. To view LIVE logs for test execution, click on the test button from the workflow test panel and get real-time\ninsights into your workflows for a faster debugging experience, you can also view the logs for each node execution.\nNote that production logs automatically get populated in the logs panel in ~45 seconds, you can click the refresh icon\nto load production logs instantly. To send a mock request, click on the test button for each execution (note: headers cannot be accessed for security\nreasons). This will help you test and rerun a request easily.

How BuildShip stores a secret securely on Google Cloud Secret Manager? Add Secret Key Input Parameter Access Secret Key in Node Logic Add Secret in BuildShip Secret Manager Select Secret Key in Node Editor Question? Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 Secrets & API Keys Using Secrets and API Keys Ensuring the security of your applications and workflows is paramount. Hardcoding sensitive information like secret keys\ndirectly into your code can lead to potential vulnerabilities and increased costs due to unauthorized access .\nBuildShip addresses this concern by providing an effective way to safeguard your secret keys using Google Cloud\nPlatform (GCP) Secret Manager under the hood. What is a Secret? A secret is an global object used within a project that holds sensitive information. This information can include things\nlike API keys, passwords, certificates, and credentials. Secrets are used to securely store, manage, and control access\nto sensitive information. In BuildShip you can add secrets in any form such as single string, json object, or a\nkey-value pair. BuildShip Secret Manager is a secure and convenient way to store and manage your secrets. \ud83d\udca1 Example: If the Secret requires a collection of data then you can also store it as a JSON Object, example: The PlayHT (opens in a new tab) secret requires a secretKey and userID. { \"secretKey\" : \"Paste your secret key\" , \"userId\" : \"Paste your userId\" } How BuildShip stores a secret securely on Google Cloud Secret Manager? BuildShip integrates with Google Cloud Secret Manager so you don't have your secrets exposed in your frontend\napplication and ensures that your keys remain confidential and are only accessed when needed. When you add a secret in\nBuildShip, it is stored in Google Cloud Secret Manager. The secret is encrypted at rest and in transit. The secret is\nonly decrypted when it is used in the workflow. Add Secret Key Input Parameter Navigate to the Node Editor for a logic node where you intend to use a secret key. In the Params section, add a new input parameter to receive the Secret Key. For example, let's say you want to use the Replicate API Key. Create an input parameter as follows: [ { key : 'apiKey' , label : 'Replicate API Key' , description : 'The API Key for Replicate' , required : false , validation : '' , type : 'string' , } , ]; or via UI Form: Save the input parameter. Access Secret Key in Node Logic Within the Node Editor, navigate to the Node Logic section. Import the input parameters into your function, for example: export default async function runMusicGenModel ({ prompt , apiKey }) { // Your code here } Use the apiKey variable to access the API Key value in your logic: const replicate = new Replicate ({ auth : apiKey , }); Save your changes. Add Secret in BuildShip Secret Manager Back to your workflow workspace, click on the Expression Icon </> corresponding to the API Key input in your\nLogic Node. Under \" Secrets ,\" click on \" Add a Secret \". This action opens the BuildShip Secret Manager. Inside the BuildShip Secret Manager, you have the ability to add, modify, or delete secret keys. Click \" Add a Secret Key \", then provide the \" Secret Name \" and \" Secret Value \" associated with your API Key. Click \" Save \" to add the secret key to the BuildShip Secret Manager. Select Secret Key in Node Editor Back in the Node Editor, within the Secrets section, click \"Refresh.\" Select the Secret Key you added from the dropdown menu. And that's it! \ud83d\ude80 By following these steps, you can seamlessly integrate secret keys into your workflows while ensuring\ntheir confidentiality and security through BuildShip's Secret Manager integration.

Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 How to connect BuildShip to your Firebase Project BuildShip provides pre-defined nodes for Firestore integration, making it easy to interact with Firebase services within\nyour workflows. BuildShip offers two options for interacting with Firebase: Using BuildShip's built-in Firestore database Connecting to your own Firebase project Option 1: Using BuildShip's Built-in Firestore Database BuildShip comes equipped with a built-in Firestore database that is automatically associated with your BuildShip\nproject. No Additional Setup: Everything is pre-configured and ready for immediate use. Easy Access: Users can directly access and interact with the Firestore database through BuildShip. Full Functionality: You can perform all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and more, making it a\ncomprehensive solution for your Firebase integration needs. \ud83d\ude80 Use the BuildShip Tables to visualize and manage your BuildShip Firestore data in a Spreadsheet UI. (This feature\nis only available for users on the Pro and Expert plan.) Learn more about BuildShip\nTables . Using BuildShip Database nodes In the Node Explorer, navigate to the \" BuildShip Database \" category. You'll find a range of nodes for various\nFirestore operations. Insert the relevant Firestore integration nodes into your workflow. Customize the nodes by\nproviding the necessary input parameters for your specific use case. You do not need to provide any additional information, like the Project ID parameter to use the BuildShip Database\nnodes. You can directly use the nodes to interact with your Firestore database. Option 2: Connecting to Your Own Firebase Project Users can connect their Firebase projects by providing the Project ID and setting up permissions for the BuildShip\nRuntime Service Account . Steps to set up your own Firebase Connection: Insert any Firebase Integration Node From the Node Explorer, insert any Firestore integration node into your workflow. Add the required fields to the node and add the Project ID of your Firebase project to which you want to add the data. Access BuildShip Settings Navigate to the Settings section, found in the top-left corner of your dashboard, next to the Project Name. Under the General tab in BuildShip Settings, you will find information about the underlying Firebase Project ID and Service Account details . Copy the Service Account details as we need this to grant access to your Firebase\nproject. Grant Access in Firebase IAM & Admin Open a new browser tab or window and go to your Firebase Project's Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console (opens in a new tab) . \u26a0\ufe0f Make sure you are logged in to the correct Google account that has access to the Firebase project you want to\nconnect to BuildShip. Also, make sure you've selected the correct Firebase project in the GCP Console. Navigate to the IAM & Admin section from the Firebase project's GCP Console. Click on the Grant Access button to add a new principal. Paste the Service Account details you copied from BuildShip into the \"New Principal\" field. Assign the role of Cloud Datastore User and Firebase Admin SDK Administrator Service Agent to the Service Account. Hit the Save button to grant access to the Service Account. This will allow BuildShip to interact with your Firebase resources. \ud83d\udca1 Please note that GCP takes time (approx 2 to ~7 minutes or more in extreme cases) for access changes through the system. For more info refer to this documentation here (opens in a new tab) . Troubleshooting Follow these troubleshooting steps incase you received the following errors: Error Codes Description Solution 7 PERMISSION_DENIED: Missing or insufficient permissions. Indicates that the request failed due to missing or insufficient IAM permissions. Check the required permissions from above steps, if provided wait for ~7 minutes for GCP to sync. 5 NOT_FOUND Indicates that the requested document or collection could not be found.

Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 Firebase Full Text Search \ud83d\udd0e Cloud Firestore does not natively support indexing or searching text fields in documents. To enable full-text search\nfunctionality in your Firebase project, we recommend integrating with a third-party search integrations like Algolia (opens in a new tab) , Elastic (opens in a new tab) , or Typesense (opens in a new tab) , which provide powerful and efficient search capabilities. The integration involves two main steps: Installing the Firebase Extension Choose a third-party search service that suits your requirements, such as Algolia , Elastic , or Typesense .\nEach service may have its own extension for Firebase. These Firebase extensions help in indexing your data and syncing it with the third-party search service everytime a CRUD\noperation is performed on your Firebase data. This helps reduce the cost of indexing and syncing your data. \ud83d\udcda Get your Firebase Extensions here! Firebase Extensions are pre-packaged solutions that you can install with a single click. Click on the links below to\ninstall the Firebase Extensions for your preferred search service: Algolia (opens in a new tab) Elastic (opens in a new tab) Typesense (opens in a new tab) Node for Performing a Full-Text Search on the Search Index This node allows you to execute full-text search queries on the data stored in the respective search index. Implementing Full Text Search Let's take a look at how to implement full-text search on your Firebase data. For this example we'll be using Algolia. Set up Algolia Go to Algolia's website (opens in a new tab) and either log in to your existing Algolia account or create a new\none if you don't have an account yet. Click on \"New Application\" and provide a name for your application. Choose an appropriate subscription plan and select\na region for your data center. After creating the application, navigate to the \"Indices\" section. Create a new index and give it a name. You can keep\nthe index name the same as your Firestore collection name for simplicity. Get Algolia Keys To perform the Full Text Search on your Firebase data, we will be using Algolia's API. To use the API, we need to get\nthe API Key, App ID, and Index Name from Algolia's Dashboard. Go to the API Keys section (opens in a new tab) in Algolia's Dashboard and copy the API\nKey and App ID . Go to the Data Sources > Indices section (opens in a new tab) in Algolia's Dashboard and\ncopy the Index Name . Install the Algolia Firebase Extension To sync your Firebase collection with Algolia's index, we need to install the Algolia Firebase Extension (opens in a new tab) . Click on the \" Install in Firebase \" button. This will open the Firebase Console in a new tab. Select the Firebase project in which you want to install the extension. If you don't have a Firebase project, you can\ncreate a new one. Proceed with the installation.You would be required to add your Algolia API Key, App ID, and Index Name to the node,\ndescribed in the previous section . Click on the \"Install\" button. This would take approximately 3-5 minutes to install on your Firebase project. Perform Full-Text Search To perform a full-text search on the Algolia index, we need to use the \" Algolia Full Text Search \" Node from the Node\nExplorer. You can find this node under the \" Algolia \" category. This node performs a full text search on an Algolia\nindex and returns a JSON object or an array of JSON objects. You would be required to add your Algolia API Key , App ID , and Index Name to the node, described in the previous section . \u2705 Store your keys in the Secret Manager The API Key is a sensitive piece of information and should not be shared\npublicly. Make sure you keep your API Key secure and do not share it with anyone. Learn how to store your API Keys as\nsecrets here . The Query input parameter is the search query that you want to execute on the Algolia index. You can add this node to your workflow to perform a full-text search on the Algolia index with your Firebase data. This is how you can perform a full-text search on your Firebase data using Algolia. You can use the same steps to\nperform a full-text search on your Firebase data using Elastic or Typesense . You can find the Full Text Search Nodes for each of these integrations under their respective categories in the Node\nExplorer.

Creating Data Reading Data Updating Data Deleting Data Filters Question? Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 Integrate Supabase DB with BuildShip BuildShip offers a powerful integration with Supabase allowing you to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)\noperations on your data with ease. This integration is achieved through the Supabase Realtime API. Prerequisites \u2705 Your Supabase Table A Supabase Table you want to integrate with BuildShip. If you don't have a Supabase project, you can create one at supabase.io (opens in a new tab) . API Key and URL Supabase provides two default API keys when you create a project: an anon key and a service_role key. These keys\ncan be found in the API Settings section of the dashboard. Before you begin, make sure you have your Supabase API key and Table URL ready. You can obtain these keys from your\nSupabase project dashboard settings: Log in to your Supabase account. Navigate to your project's dashboard. In the dashboard settings, find and copy your API key and Table URL. These keys will be used to connect BuildShip with\nyour Supabase project. The anon Key The anon key has very limited privileges and is designed to be used in Row Level Security (RLS) policies to\nallow unauthenticated access to specific database tables or rows. For example : a policy can be created to allow\npublic access to the profiles table using the anon key. The service_role Key The service_role key has elevated privileges and can bypass RLS policies . This key should only be used on a\nprivate server and never exposed to users or client-side applications. Supabase Row-Level Security (RLS) The BuildShip Supabase nodes use the Supabase Data APIs which are designed to work with Postgres Row Level Security\n(RLS) . Enabling Row Level Security Any table you create in the public schema will be accessible via the Supabase Data API. To restrict access, enable Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables, views, and functions in the public schema. You can\nthen write RLS policies to grant users access to specific database rows or functions based on their authentication\ntoken. \ud83d\udca1 To learn how to set up the Supabase Row Level Security, read the Supabase Docs here (opens in a new tab) . API Endpoints (Optional - For creating your own custom nodes) You can get access to API endpoints directly from your table by clicking on the \"API\" button located at the top right\ncorner of the Supabase table view. This is useful if you wish to create your own custom nodes for specific endpoints. \ud83d\udca1 To perform CRUD operations on your Supabase database, you'll be required to create a custom RLS Policy (Row Level Security). By default, Supabase RLS is enabled to restrict all access using the anon key, this will prevent any operation and might result in an empty array. Note: You can also disable the RLS, but its not recommended. You can securely store your Supabase API key using\nBuildShip's secret manager, learn more here . When to use Tokens? BuildShip offers two sets of Supabase nodes, one with Authorization Token and one without. The with Token nodes are a\nslightly adapted version to support an Authorization token being passed in from your client . This allows Supabase\nRow Level Security to be utilised as a passthrough with Buildship. What this means is that you can use the with Token nodes when you are using BuildShip along with FlutterFlow or\nother no-code frontend tools , and authenticating with Supabase using their out-of-the-box functionality. This will\nallow you to securely pass the Authorization token from your client to BuildShip. \ud83d\udca1 If you're interesting in knowing more about passing the authorization token from your FlutterFlow app to BuildShip,\nyou can read the detailed guide here (opens in a new tab) . If your use case does not require passing the Authorization token from your client to BuildShip, you can use the nodes\nwithout the Authorization Token . Creating Data With BuildShip's integration, you can easily create new records in your Supabase PostgreSQL database. Follow these\nsteps: In your BuildShip Workflow, add a Supabase Create Node from the Node Explorer. You can find the Supabase Create Node\nunder the \"Supabase\" integration category or you could simply enter Supabase on the search bar. Configure the node by providing your Supabase API Key, Bearer Token, Table URL, and Table Name. Open the Node Editor to test your node. Add the data you want to create in the \"Data\" field in the form of a JSON object. Here's an example of a JSON object\nyou can use to create a new record in your Supabase table: { \"breed_name\" : \"Birman\" , \"country_of_origin\" : \"Burma\" } Test your node by clicking on the \"Test\" button. If the node is configured correctly, you should see a new record in\nyour Supabase table. Optionally, you could modify and customize the node according to your needs. Once you're done, click on the \"Save\"\nbutton to save your node. Add more nodes or simply add a Return node to complete your workflow. \ud83d\udca1 BuildShip offers two versions of Supabase nodes, with and without Authorization Token. The with Token nodes are a slightly adapted version to support an Authorization token being passed in from your client . This allows Supabase Row Level Security to be utilised as a passthrough with Buildship. This is useful for users using BuildShip along with FlutterFlow or other no-code frontend tools, and authenticating with\nSupabase using their out-of-the-box functionality. Note: If you do not have an Access Token, use the Supabase \"Create Row\" node instead. Reading Data To retrieve data from your Supabase database, use the Read Node: In your BuildShip workflow, add a Supabase Read Node from the Node Explorer. You can find the Supabase Create Node\nunder the \"Supabase\" integration category or you could simply enter Supabase on the search bar. Configure the node by providing your Supabase API Key, Bearer Token, Table URL, and Table Name. Specify the columns you want to retrieve from your table in the \"Columns\" field. You can also leave it empty which\nwill by default retrieve all columns. Optionally you could customize, test and save the node. Execute the workflow, and BuildShip will fetch the data from your Supabase database in real-time. Now you can use this data anywhere in your workflow via the Expressions menu. Updating Data Updating records in your Supabase database is straightforward with the Update Node: In your BuildShip workflow, add a Supabase Update Node from the Node Explorer. Configure the node by providing your Supabase API Key, Bearer Token, Table URL, and Table Name. You need to add conditions to specify which records should be updated using filters like eq , lt , and is . \ud83d\udca1 Refer to the Filters section below for more information on how to use filters. You can optionally customize, test and save the node. Deploy your workflow, and everytime your workflow triggers, your data will be updated in your Supabase database in\nreal-time. Deleting Data To delete records from your Supabase database, use the Delete Node: In your BuildShip workflow, add a Supabase Delete Node from the Node Explorer. Configure the node by providing your Supabase API Key, Bearer Token, Table URL, and Table Name. Add filters to specify which records should be deleted using filters like eq , lt , and is . \ud83d\udca1 Refer to the Filters section below for more information on how to use filters. Deploy your workflow and the specified records will be deleted from your Supabase database in real-time. Filters Filters are used to specify which records should be retrieved, updated, or deleted. You can add multiple filters to a\nnode. Here's a list of all the filters you can use: Operator Description Example Example Explanation eq Filter records where a specific field is equal to a given value name=eq.siamese Match records where the name field is equal to siamese neq Filters records where a specific field is not equal to a given value age=neq.5 Match records where the age field is not equal to 5 gt Filter records where a specific field is greater than a given value age=gt.30 Match records where the age field is greater than 30 lt Filters records where a specific field is less than a given value price=lt.10 Match records where the price field is less than 10 gte Filters records where a specific field is greater than or equal to a given value quantity=gte.100 Match records where the quantity field is greater than or equal to 100 lte Filters records where a specific field is less than or equal to a given value rating=lte.4.5 Match records where the rating field is less than or equal to 4.5 is Filters records via comparing fields with specific values or conditions, such as checking if a field is null email=is.null Match records where the email field is null like Filters records via partial string matching name=like.%John% Match records where the name field contains John anywhere in the string \ud83d\udca1 To use multiple filters, use the & operator to separate them. For example, to filter records where the origin field equals Germany and the lifespan field is greater than 15 , you would use the following filter: origin=eq.Germany&lifespan=gte.15 .

Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) This tutorial demonstates how you can implement \"Bring Your Own Key\" (BYOK) feature in BuildShip. BYOK allows\nindividual users or businesses to let their end-users integrate their own API keys within workflows. This ensures greater flexibility and cost management, particularly in scenarios where multiple users or clients require\nseparate API access. Let's dig deeper into how you can implement BYOK in your BuildShip workflows. Prerequisites \u2705 A system within your front-end application where users can input and securely store their respective API keys. \ud83d\udd10 Ensure that the provided keys are securely stored on your platform, implementing necessary security measures to\nprotect sensitive information. Accessing BYOK keys Passing the user's API Key in the Request Pass the user's API key as an Authorization header in the request made to your BuildShip's API. This header will\nserve as a means to authenticate and authorize the user's access to specific functionalities within your workflow. Accessing the API Key You can easily access the user's API key from the Request's Authorization Headers : Click on the Edit icon (\u270e) for the input field where you want to access the API key. Access the \" Request \" variable from the dropdown menu and select \" Headers \". Then, select the \" Authorization \" header from the list of headers. BYOK Example Workflow Let's take a look at how you can implement BYOK in your BuildShip workflow using the OpenAI Text Generator model within\nBuildShip: This workflow showcases the use of the OpenAI Text Generator node, ensuring that each user can utilize their individual\nAPI keys and prompts received from request parameters. \"Get Authorization Header\" Node Validates the presence of the Authorization Header in the incoming request, ensuring the user's API key is included. \"Get Query Param\" Node Validates the existence of the prompt query parameter in the incoming request, which provides the prompt for Text\nGeneration. \"OpenAI Text Generator\" Node API Key Input: Retrieves the Authorization Header from the incoming request containing the user's unique API\nkey. User Prompt Input: Fetches the Query Parameters from the incoming request, acquiring the specific prompt for Text Generation. \ud83d\udca1 Click here (opens in a new tab) to get a JSON File\nfor this example workflow which can be copied and pasted to your own project.

Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 Secure Your API Endpoint As you build, ship, and deploy workflows on BuildShip, it's crucial to ensure the security of your API endpoint when\nmaking it accessible on the internet. Using Authorization Header The Authorization header provides the server with information to authenticate and authorize the client making a request.\nIt typically contains a token or credentials that the server uses to validate the client\u2019s identity and grant or deny\naccess to the requested resource. Accessing Authorization Header To secure your API endpoint, you can utilize the REST API Authorization Header to validates the API key. It enables\nto authenticate and authorize users, protecting the API from unauthorized access. Follow these simple steps: Click on the Edit icon (\u270e) on the REST API Trigger. Add a new input under Request Headers - authorization. Click on Save. Adding Condition to Validate Header To enhance security, use a Branch Node to add a condition that validates and verifies the authorization header in the\nAPI request: Set the condition in the Branch Node as Authorization Header Value == key-to-match . Utilize variables for\nflexibility (refer to the image below). Organize your workflow nodes into the \"then\" and \"else\" conditions accordingly. Congratulations! Your API Endpoint is Now Secured With the implemented security measures, you can confidently test and ship your workflow, ensuring the endpoint's safe\nusage within your application. Your workflow structure should resemble the following after following the above steps: Additional Resources for Database Integration For Supabase Database If you're using Supabase as your database, refer to this video tutorial that demonstrates building a complete secure\nSupabase application from scratch.

Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 Vector Database Applications with BuildShip Vector databases are a powerful tool for efficiently storing and retrieving unstructured data like text, images, and\naudio using vector embeddings and similarity-based searches . Unlike traditional databases that rely on exact keyword matching, vector databases use vector embeddings to\nrepresent data in high-dimensional vector spaces. This approach enables similarity-based searches , making it easier\nto find relevant information even when exact matches are not available. One of the key applications of vector databases is in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) , where they are\nused in conjunction with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models. These models leverage vector databases to\nretrieve relevant information from large text corpora, which is then used to generate more informed and context-aware\nresponses . With BuildShip, you can quickly and easily create vector database applications, streamlining the process of ingesting\ntext, creating vector embeddings, and performing efficient vector searches. SECTION 1: Creating a Vector Database Vector databases are designed to store and retrieve vector embeddings , which are high-dimensional numerical\nrepresentations of text or other data. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the data, allowing for efficient\nsimilarity searches based on vector distances. In a vector database, each entry typically consists of an ID, metadata, and the vector embedding itself . For\nexample, a JSON object representing a text entry might look like this: { \"id\" : \"text_1\" , \"metadata\" : { \"source\" : \"example.com\" , \"title\" : \"Introduction to Vector Databases\" } , \"embedding\" : [ 0.021 , -0.032 , 0.112 , ... ] } The process of generating vector embeddings involves using a machine learning model trained on large text corpora.\nOne popular option is OpenAI's ada embedding model , which can generate embeddings for text up to 8,192 tokens\n(approximately 8,000 words). BuildShip offers a pre-built node for generating embeddings using the OpenAI ada model , making it easy to integrate\ninto your workflows. \ud83d\udca1 OpenAI provides comprehensive documentation on their embeddings API, learn\nmore (opens in a new tab) . Several vector database services are available, each with its own features and pricing models. BuildShip provides\npre-built, ready-to-use CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) nodes for Pinecone , a managed vector database service. Know more. (opens in a new tab) . Additionally, MongoDB , a popular NoSQL database, can also be used as a vector database by storing\nvector embeddings as data fields. \ud83d\udca1 BuildShip let\u2019s you easily build custom nodes for MongoDB or other databases using Generate with AI . EXAMPLE: Syncing Documentation to a Vector Index Here's an example of how you can use BuildShip to sync documentation to a vector index: In this example we're using the sitemap for the documentation website to get all the URL paths for the content present\non the website. We have an \" XML to JSON \" node that converts the sitemap XML to JSON format. Next, we use the \" Concat Property Values \" nodes to extract the paths from the JSON object to get an array of URLs. Then we pass the list of the URLs to a loop node. The loop node will iterate through each URL and fetch the content\nfrom the URL using the \" Scrape Web URL \" node. Inside the loop, we can generate the vector embeddings using the\n\" Generate Embeddings \" node, and parse it into a JSON format which we'll be able to use for upserting the data\ninto the vector index. Finally, outside the loop, we can use the \" Upsert Document \" node to add the documents to the vector index. For\nthis example, we've used the Pinecone vector database. This process allows you to quickly and easily ingest text data, generate vector embeddings, and add documents to the\nvector index. SECTION 2: Querying the Vector Database Once you have ingested your data into a vector database, you can perform efficient similarity-based searches to retrieve\nrelevant information. This process involves comparing the vector embeddings of a query with the embeddings of the stored\ndocuments to find the most similar matches. How to Query the Vector Database Convert the question/prompt to a vector embedding: The first step is to convert your question or prompt into a\nvector embedding using the same model and process used for generating embeddings during the data ingestion stage. Query the vector database collection: With the vector embedding of your prompt, you can query your vector database\ncollection to retrieve the top relevant documents based on vector similarity. This is typically achieved by specifying\na topK parameter, which determines the number of closest vector matches to return. \ud83d\udca1 BuildShip offers a bunch of pre-built nodes for querying vector databases available in the Node Library, making it\nsuper easy to integrate vector searches into your workflows. Utilize the retrieved data: The top relevant documents retrieved from the vector database can be used in various\nways, depending on your requirements. For example, you could display the relevant documents directly to the user,\nextract specific information from the documents, or pass the data to an AI model for further processing. EXAMPLE: Creating a Chat Bot One compelling use case for querying vector databases is the creation of a chat bot trained on your specific data. This\napproach is significantly more efficient and straightforward compared to alternatives like fine-tuning language\nmodels , which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. By leveraging a vector database, you can create a chat bot that provides precise and relevant responses based on the\ndata stored in the vector index. Here's an example of how you can query a vector index, retrieve relevant data, and pass\nit to an AI model to generate a response: In this example, we first convert the prompt to a vector embedding . Then, we query the vector index to retrieve\nthe top 3 most relevant documents based on vector similarity. The text content of these documents is concatenated to\nform the context, which is passed along with the prompt to an AI model. The AI model can then generate a precise\nresponse by leveraging both the prompt and the relevant context from the vector database.

Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 Supabase Postgres RPC The Supabase Postgres RPC node allows you to call Postgres functions in your Supabase database as Remote Procedure\nCalls (RPCs) . This enables you to execute logic stored in your database from anywhere, making it useful for scenarios\nwhere the logic rarely changes, such as password resets or data updates. Setting up a Supabase Postgres Function Before you can call a Postgres function using the Supabase Postgres RPC node, you need to set up the function in your\nSupabase project. Follow these steps: STEP 1: Open the SQL editor in your Supabase project. STEP 2: Use the CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION statement to define your function. STEP 3: Specify the function name, parameters, return type, and language (e.g., SQL or plpgsql). STEP 4: Write the function body between the $$ delimiters. STEP 5: Execute the SQL statement to create the function. Sample Function Here's an example of a simple function that takes in the row_id as an argument and increments the lifespan field by 1 in the \" Dog Breeds \" table: create or replace function getBreed (row_id int ) returns void as $$ update \"Dog Breeds\" set lifespan = lifespan + 1 where id = row_id; $$ language sql volatile; \ud83d\udca1 For more detailed instructions on setting up database functions in Supabase, refer to the dedicated documentation here (opens in a new tab) . Invoking the Supabase Postgres Function Once you have set up the Postgres function in your Supabase project, you can invoke it using the Supabase Postgres RPC\nnode in your BuildShip workflow. Here are the inputs required by the node: API Key : Your Supabase API Key. You can obtain this from the API Reference section in your Supabase Project\nDashboard. Learn more here . API URL : The URL of your Supabase project. You can find this in the API Reference section of your Supabase Project\nDashboard. Learn more here . Function Name : The name of the Postgres function you want to call. For example: getBreed . Arguments (optional) : The arguments to pass to the function, if required. For example, if your function expects a row_id argument, you can provide it as an object: { \"row_id\" : 2 } So, in this example, the Supabase Postgres RPC node will call the getBreed function in your Supabase database, passing\nin 2 as the row_id argument. The response from the function will be returned as the output of the node. Need Help? \ud83d\udcac Join BuildShip Community An active and large community of no-code / low-code builders.

Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with BuildShip Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful method that combines document retrieval with text generation,\nenhancing the quality and relevance of generated content. In a typical RAG setup, documents are chunked into small\nsubsections, and similarity searches are performed over those sections to find the most relevant information. Starter Templates To help you get started with RAG, we provide two starter templates. These templates serve as a foundation, and you can\ncustomize and extend them as per your requirements. You can access the RAG using Meilisearch templates from this Remix link (opens in a new tab) . Template 1: Add Document Chunk to Meilisearch This template allows you to upload a file, which is then processed and stored in BuildShip storage. The steps involved\nare: File Upload : Upload a file via the file upload trigger to the path /add-document-chunks using the POST method. Document Creation : The uploaded file is stored in the files collection in BuildShip storage with metadata,\nincluding size, mimeType, encoding, and originalName. File Storage : The file buffer is saved to BuildShip storage under uploads/${file.id} . Document Update : The document in the files collection is updated with the download URL of the stored file. Content Extraction : The file content is extracted using the PDF to Text node with the provided download URL.\nCurrently, this template supports PDF files. Chunking : The extracted content is split into chunks of 1000 characters. This node is generated using the Node Generator . You can try creating a similar node by providing the following\ninputs to the Node Generator: Given : an input string and a specified chunk size I want to : split the input string into chunks, replacing newline characters with spaces And return : an array containing the string chunks Indexing : The chunks are added to the Meilisearch index assistant . \ud83d\udca1 Currently, this template supports PDF files. However, you can customize the template to support different file types\nby adding the appropriate extraction nodes. Template 2: RAG using Meilisearch This template performs a hybrid search on the Meilisearch instance where document chunks were previously added. The\nsteps involved are: Hybrid Search : Perform a search on the Meilisearch instance to retrieve relevant knowledge based on the user's\nquery. Text Generation : Use the OpenAI text generator to generate content by providing the retrieved knowledge as\ncontext. Sample System Prompt is given below. ( Replace chunks and userQuery with node values ): Leverage relevant knowledge from MeiliSearch and the latest user query to create a clear, coherent, and engaging response. **Relevant Knowledge**: Use text chunks from documents stored in MeiliSearch. - **Extracted Chunks**: ${chunks.map(chunk => chunk.extractedText).join(\"\\n\\n\")} - **User Query**: Address the latest user inquiry. - Current Query: ${userQuery} **Strategy**: - **Analysis**: Combine document chunks and the user query. - **Engagement**: Provide explanations or educated guesses as needed. - **Continuity**: Build on the conversation's direction. **Output**: - **Format**: Use clear language with markdown. - **Structure**: Organize into cohesive paragraphs. - **Depth**: Be informative and concise. Understanding RAG RAG leverages the strengths of both retrieval and generation. It retrieves relevant information from a large corpus of\ndocuments and uses that information to generate detailed and contextually accurate responses. This approach\nsignificantly enhances the capabilities of AI models, especially in scenarios requiring specific and factual\ninformation. How RAG Works Document Chunking : Large documents are divided into smaller, manageable sections. This ensures that searches are\nmore efficient and relevant. Vector Embeddings : Each document chunk is converted into a high-dimensional vector using embeddings. These\nembeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text. Similarity Search : When a query is made, it is also converted into a vector. A similarity search is then\nperformed to find document chunks that are semantically similar to the query. Text Generation : The retrieved chunks are provided as context to a text generation model, which produces a\nresponse based on the combined knowledge. Use Case For this use case, we are going to use RAG with MongoDB templates instead of RAG with Meilisearch templates. However,\nyou can use Meilisearch as well if that suits your needs. You can also tweak the starter templates to use with any other\nplatform. Currently, the templates are created for Meilisearch and MongoDB only, but you can use other database nodes\nwhich are in the node library to modify these templates according to your needs. For example, you can use Supabase nodes\nif you want. Additionally, you can extend the starter templates as needed. Here, we are providing you with the basic\nsetup and use case for using RAG with BuildShip. Knowledge Management System for a Research Organization Overview: A research organization needs an efficient system to manage its vast collection of research papers,\nreports, and documents. The goal is to create a Knowledge Management System (KMS) that allows researchers to easily\nretrieve relevant information from their database of documents to support their ongoing projects and inquiries. Problem Statement: Researchers at the organization often need to refer to previous studies, reports, and papers.\nManually searching through documents is time-consuming and inefficient, leading to delays and potential oversight of\nrelevant information. Solution: Implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that accepts PDF files of research papers,\nextracts their content, chunks it, and saves it in MongoDB. When a researcher queries the system, a hybrid search\nretrieves the most relevant chunks from MongoDB and uses OpenAI's text generation to provide comprehensive, contextually\nrelevant responses. You can access the RAG using MongoDB templates from this Remix link (opens in a new tab) . Add Document Chunks: Use the Add Document Chunks template to add chunks to your MongoDB collection. In this case, we are using two\ncollections: files - to store file details. The files are stored in BuildShip storage. You can set it inside the Insert\nDocument node. The template currently stores the following details: [{ size : size of the file , mimeType : mimeType of the file , encoding : file encoding , originalName : original file name }] chunks - to store file chunks. You can set the collection name in the last Insert Document node. Currently, we\nare storing the chunk under the extractedText field and also the following fields with the document: { fileId : id we get after we insert file details into files collection , position : chunk index , originalName : original file name , extractedText : chunk , downloadUrl : downloadable file public URL } Set the upload destination to the location uploads/id . You can set the destination inside the Upload File node. Set the chunk size to 100 characters. You can set it inside the Split into Chunks node. Configure the templates to work with your MongoDB cluster and fill the nodes with the above details. After configuring, execute the workflow by uploading a Sample File (opens in a new tab) to chunk the document content and store the chunks in MongoDB. Create Embeddings: Use the Create Embeddings template to create vector embeddings for the document chunks. Configure the template with your MongoDB connection and OpenAI secrets. Detailed configuration steps can be found here (opens in a new tab) . Fetch the _id and extractedText fields of each document from the chunks collection. You can tweak this inside the Query Collection node under Projection . Run the template to generate embeddings for the stored chunks. The embeddings will be saved in each document with the\nfield name embedding . Configure Atlas Search Index: Before using RAG, we need to configure search indexes for hybrid search which is more accurate for this purpose. Set up the Atlas Search index and Atlas Vector Search index. Follow the detailed steps provided in the below\ndocumentation: Atlas Search index (opens in a new tab) Atlas Vector Search index (opens in a new tab) Use RAG with MongoDB: Use the RAG using MongoDB template, which includes hybrid search and OpenAI nodes. Configure the template to perform hybrid search on the stored chunks and generate content using OpenAI. Use the chunks\ncollection and related search index names inside the hybrid search node. Refer to the above sections to craft a better\nsystem prompt for the OpenAI node using retrieved chunks from hybrid search. Test the system with user queries to retrieve and generate relevant information. By following these steps, the research organization can effectively manage and retrieve information from their extensive\ndocument database, enhancing their research capabilities and efficiency.

Give us feedback \u2192 (opens in a new tab) Edit this page on GitHub \u2197 Productivity Google Workspace Gsheets Google Sheets Nodes The Google Sheets Nodes allow you to interact with your Google Sheets account. You can create, update, and delete\nspreadsheets, as well as read and write data to them. Node name Description API Reference Get Sheets Returns the spreadsheet at the given ID Get Sheet (opens in a new tab) Create Sheet Initializes a new spreadsheet Create Sheet (opens in a new tab) Add Row Add / updates row values in the sheet Variation of the Batch Update node (opens in a new tab) Batch Update Sheet Applies one or more updates to the spreadsheet. Batch Update Sheet (opens in a new tab) Get Sheets Fetches a Google Spreadsheet by utilizing the Google Sheets API. This function requires the URL of the Google\nSpreadsheet and optionally a specific range within the sheet to fetch the data from. Loading... Inputs To effectively use this node, you need to provide the following inputs: Sheet URL The URL of the Google Spreadsheet you want to fetch. The URL is available in your Google Sheets. You\ncan copy it from the address bar of your browser. Sample Input: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/spreadsheet-id/edit Sheet Name The name of the sheet within the Google Spreadsheet. This can be found at the bottom left corner of\nyour Google Sheet. You can also specify a range if needed, for example, Sheet1!B2:B if you want to read the B column except the header row. Sample Input: Sheet1 Output The node returns the content of the Google Spreadsheet in the following structure: majorDimension: Represents the dimension used when reporting data (e.g., ROWS or COLUMNS). values: An array of arrays containing the data from the specified range. range: The range over which the data is retrieved. Here's a sample of what the output looks like: { \"majorDimension\" : \"ROWS\" , \"values\" : [ [ \"Name\" , \"Age\" , \"Location\" ] , [ \"Alice\" , \"30\" , \"New York\" ] , [ \"Bob\" , \"25\" , \"San Francisco\" ] ] , \"range\" : \"Sheet1!A1:C3\" } Create Sheet The \"Create Sheet\" node initializes a new Google Spreadsheet with a specified name. This node leverages the Google\nSheets API to create a new spreadsheet, offering a foundation for further data manipulation and storage. Loading... Inputs The node requires the following input: Sheet Name : The name or title for the new spreadsheet to be created. This string input is essential to identify\nthe newly created sheet. Sample Input: Testing Data Output Upon successful creation, the node returns an object containing the following properties: spreadsheetId: A unique string identifier for the created spreadsheet. spreadsheetUrl: A string URL that links directly to the new spreadsheet. sheets: An array of sheet objects, each with properties detailing the sheet type, ID, index, title, and grid\nproperties including row and column counts. properties: An object with additional attributes such as the spreadsheet theme, auto-recalculation settings, time\nzone, title, locale, and default formatting options. These output properties collectively describe the newly created spreadsheet, making it easy to locate, access, and\nfurther customize. Add Row The Add Row node integrates with Google Sheets to append new rows of data to a specific spreadsheet. This\nfunctionality is ideal for automating the addition of data entries, ensuring your Google Sheets stay up-to-date\neffortlessly. Loading... Inputs To use this node, you need to provide the following inputs: Sheet URL The URL of the Google Spreadsheet where the rows will be added. Sample Input : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OEgMxmFd29SGjEuJZ58ee94W_aU0Xx4pUngG628uJsk Sheet Name The name of the sheet within the spreadsheet. You can find this in the bottom left corner of your\nGoogle Sheet. Sample Input : Sheet1 Cell Number The cell number to start adding the new row. This prevents accidental overwrites. We can also use\nthis field to specify range. For example, if we just want to write to the C column except the header row, we could\nspecify: C2:C and select the Dimension field as column . Sample Input : A11 or C2:C Data Array The new values to be added as rows to the spreadsheet. Each sub-array represents a row. Sample\nInput : [ [\"Cell1\", \"Cell2\"], [\"Cell3\", \"Cell4\"] ] Dimension The major dimension of the values to be added, either ROWS or COLUMNS . Sample Input : ROWS Output The output of this node is the response from the Google Sheets API, which includes the details of the updated\nspreadsheet. It provides information about the cells that were modified, ensuring that the data was added correctly. Batch Update Sheet Batch updates values in a Google Sheet. This node is technically a bit complex to entertain more versatile use cases. To\nsimply add values to a Google Sheet, check out the Add Row node. Loading... Inputs To use this node, you'll need to provide the following inputs: Sheet URL : The URL of the Google Spreadsheet to update. Available in the following format in your Google Sheets: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/spreadsheet-id/edit . Refer API Documentation (opens in a new tab) . Value Input Option : Specifies how the input data should be interpreted. It can be either RAW or USER_ENTERED .\nThis determines how the input data is interpreted by the Google Sheets API. Data : The new values to apply to the spreadsheet. Example input: [ { \"range\" : \"Sheet1!A1:B2\" , // Range to update in A1 notation \"majorDimension\" : \"ROWS\" , // ROWS or COLUMNS \"values\" : [ [ \"New Value 1\" , \"New Value 2\" ] , [ \"New Value 3\" , \"New Value 4\" ] ] } ] Include Values In Response : Determines if the update response should include the values of the cells that were\nupdated. Defaults to true . Response Value Render Option : Determines how values in the response should be rendered. Options include FORMATTED_VALUE , UNFORMATTED_VALUE , and FORMULA . Response Date Time Render Option : Determines how dates, times, and durations in the response should be rendered.\nOptions include SERIAL_NUMBER and FORMATTED_STRING . Output The output of this node will be an object representing the response from the Google Sheets API, containing details about\nthe batch update operation. Example output: { \"spreadsheetId\" : \"sampleSpreadsheetId\" , \"totalUpdatedRows\" : 2 , \"totalUpdatedColumns\" : 2 , \"totalUpdatedCells\" : 4 , \"totalUpdatedSheets\" : 1 } This response will include various metrics on the number of affected rows, columns, cells, and sheets due to the batch\nupdate operation.
